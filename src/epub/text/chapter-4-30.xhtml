				<p>—And pray, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, leaning upon <i>Yorick</i>, as he and my father were helping him leisurely down the stairs⁠⸺⁠don’t be terrified, madam, this staircase conversation is not so long as the last⁠⸺⁠And pray, <i>Yorick</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, which way is this said affair of <i>Tristram</i> at length settled by these learned men? Very satisfactorily, replied <i>Yorick</i>; no mortal, Sir, has any concern with it⁠⸺⁠for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i> the mother is nothing at all akin to him⁠⸺⁠and as the mother’s is the surest side⁠⸺⁠<abbr>Mr.</abbr> <i>Shandy</i>, in course, is still less than nothing⁠⸻In short, he is not as much akin to him, Sir, as I am.⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠That may well be, said my father, shaking his head.</p>
				<p>⸺⁠Let the learned say what they will, there must certainly, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, have been some sort of consanguinity betwixt the duchess of <i>Suffolk</i> and her son.</p>
				<p>The vulgar are of the same opinion, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, to this hour.</p>
