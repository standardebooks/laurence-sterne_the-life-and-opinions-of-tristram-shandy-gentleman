Brother <i>Toby</i>, answered my father, if a child was but fairly begot, and born alive, and healthy, and the mother did well after it,⁠—our forefathers never looked farther.⁠⸺⁠My uncle <i>Toby</i> instantly withdrew his hand from off my father’s knee, reclined his body gently back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see the cornice of the room, and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his cheeks, and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty⁠—he whistled <i>Lillabullero</i>.</p>
