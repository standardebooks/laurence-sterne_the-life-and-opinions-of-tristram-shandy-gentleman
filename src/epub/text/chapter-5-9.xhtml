———To us, <i>Jonathan</i>, who know not what want or
care is—who live here in the service of two of the best of
masters—(bating in my own case his majesty King <i>William</i> the
Third, whom I had the honour to serve both in <i>Ireland</i> and
<i>Flanders</i>)—I own it, that from <i>Whitsontide</i> to
within three weeks of <i>Christmas</i>,—’tis not long—’tis
like nothing;—but to those, <i>Jonathan</i>, who know what death
is, and what havock and destruction he can make, before a man can well
wheel about—’tis like a whole age.—O <i>Jonathan!</i>
’twould make a good-natured man’s heart bleed, to consider, continued
the corporal (standing perpendicularly), how low many a brave and
upright fellow has been laid since that time!—And trust me,
<i>Susy</i>, added the corporal, turning to <i>Susannah</i>, whose eyes
were swimming in water,—before that time comes round
again,—many a bright eye will be dim.—<i>Susannah</i> placed
it to the right side of the page—she wept—but she court’sied
too.—Are we not, continued <i>Trim</i>, looking still at
<i>Susannah</i>—are we not like a flower of the
field—a tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of
humiliation—else no tongue could have described <i>Susannah’s</i>
affliction—is not all flesh grass?—’Tis clay,—’tis
dirt.—They all looked directly at the scullion,—the scullion
had just been scouring a fish-kettle.—It was not <span class="locked">fair.——</span></p>
<p>—What is the finest face that ever man looked at!—I could
hear <i>Trim</i> talk so for ever, cried <i>Susannah</i>,—what is
it! (<i>Susannah</i> laid her hand upon <i>Trim’s</i>
shoulder)—but corruption?——<i>Susannah</i> took it
off.</p>
<p>Now I love you for this—and ’tis this delicious mixture within
you which makes you dear creatures what you are—and he who hates
you for it———all I can say of the matter is—That
he has either a pumpkin for his head—or a pippin for his
heart,—and whenever he is dissected ’twill be found so.</p>
