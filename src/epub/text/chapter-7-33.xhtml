				<p>When all was set to rights, I came down stairs again into the <i>basse cour</i> with my <i>valet de place</i>, in order to sally out towards the tomb of the two lovers, &amp;c.—and was a second time stopp’d at the gate——not by the ass—but by the person who struck him; and who, by that time, had taken possession (as is not uncommon after a defeat) of the very spot of ground where the ass stood.</p>
				<p>It was a commissary sent to me from the post-office, with a rescript in his hand for the payment of some six livres odd sous.</p>
				<p>Upon what account? said I.——’Tis upon the part of the king, replied the commissary, heaving up both his <span class="locked">shoulders——</span></p>
				<p>——My good friend, quoth I——as sure as I am I—and you are <span class="locked">you——</span></p>
				<p>——And who are you? said he.———Don’t puzzle me; said I.</p>
