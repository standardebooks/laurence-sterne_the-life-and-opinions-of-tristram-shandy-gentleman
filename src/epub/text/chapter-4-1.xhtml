			<p>With all this learning upon Noses running perpetually in my father’s fancy⁠⸺⁠with so many family prejudices⁠—and ten decads of such tales running on for ever along with them⁠⸺⁠how was it possible with such exquisite⁠⸺⁠was it a true nose?⁠⸺⁠That a man with such exquisite feelings as my father had, could bear the shock at all below stairs⁠⸺⁠or indeed above stairs, in any other posture, but the very posture I have described?</p>
			<p>⸺⁠Throw yourself down upon the bed, a dozen times⁠⸺⁠taking care only to place a looking-glass first in a chair on one side of it, before you do it⁠—But was the stranger’s nose a true nose, or was it a false one?</p>
			<p>To tell that beforehand, madam, would be to do injury to one of the best tales in the Christian-world; and that is the tenth of the tenth decad, which immediately follows this.</p>
			<p>This tale, cried <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, somewhat exultingly, has been reserved by me for the concluding tale of my whole work; knowing right well, that when I shall have told it, and my reader shall have read it thro’⁠—’twould be even high time for both of us to shut up the book; inasmuch, continues <i>Slawkenbergius</i>, as I know of no tale which could possibly ever go down after it.</p>
			<p class="short-indent">’Tis a tale indeed!</p>
			<p>This sets out with the first interview in the inn at <i>Lyons</i>, when <i>Fernandez</i> left the courteous stranger and his sister <i>Julia</i> alone in her chamber, and is overwritten</p>

				<p>Heavens! thou art a strange creature, <i>Slawkenbergius!</i> what a whimsical view of the involutions of the heart of woman hast thou opened! how this can ever be translated, and yet if this specimen of <i>Slawkenbergius’s</i> tales, and the exquisitiveness of his moral, should please the world⁠—translated shall a couple of volumes be.⁠⸻Else, how this can ever be translated into good <i>English</i>, I have no sort of conception.⁠—There seems in some passages to want a sixth sense to do it rightly.⁠⸺⁠What can he mean by the lambent pupilability of slow, low, dry chat, five notes below the natural tone⁠⸺⁠which you know, madam, is little more than a whisper? The moment I pronounced the words, I could perceive an attempt towards a vibration in the strings, about the region of the heart.⁠⸻The brain made no acknowledgment.⁠⸺⁠There’s often no good understanding betwixt ’em⁠—I felt as if I understood it.⁠⸺⁠I had no ideas.⁠⸺⁠The movement could not be without cause.⁠—I’m lost. I can make nothing of it⁠—unless, may it please your worships, the voice, in that case being little more than a whisper, unavoidably forces the eyes to approach not only within six inches of each other⁠—but to look into the pupils⁠—is not that dangerous?⁠⸺⁠But it can’t be avoided⁠—for to look up to the ceiling, in that case the two chins unavoidably meet⁠⸺⁠and to look down into each other’s lap, the foreheads come to immediate contact, which at once puts an end to the conference⁠⸺⁠I mean to the sentimental part of it.⁠⸺⁠What is left, madam, is not worth stooping for.</p>
