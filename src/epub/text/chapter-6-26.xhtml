<p><span class="firstword">The</span> corporal, who the night before
had resolved in his mind to supply the grand <i>desideratum</i>, of
keeping up something like an incessant firing upon the enemy during the
heat of the attack,—had no further idea in his fancy at that time,
than a contrivance
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page333" name="page333">333</a></span>
of smoking tobacco against the town, out of one of my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> six field-pieces, which were planted on each side of his
sentry-box; the means of effecting which occurring to his fancy at the
time same, though he had pledged his cap, he thought it in no danger
from the miscarriage of his projects.</p>
<p>Upon turning it this way, and that, a little in his mind, he soon
began to find out, that by means of his two <i>Turkish</i>
tobacco-pipes, with the supplement of three smaller tubes of
wash-leather at each of their lower ends, to be tagg’d by the same
number of tin-pipes fitted to the touch-holes, and sealed with clay next
the cannon, and then tied hermetically with waxed silk at their several
insertions into the <i>Morocco</i> tube,—he should be able to fire
the six field-pieces all together, and with the same ease as to fire
<span class="locked">one.———</span></p>
<p>——Let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may not
be cut out for the advancement of human knowledge. Let no man, who has
read my father’s first and second <i>beds of justice</i>, ever rise up
and say again, from collision of what kinds of bodies light may or may
not be struck out, to carry the arts and sciences up to
perfection.——Heaven! thou knowest how I love
them;——thou knowest the secrets of my heart, and that I
would this moment give my shirt——Thou art a fool,
<i>Shandy</i>, says <i>Eugenius</i>, for thou hast but a dozen in the
world,—and ’twill break thy <span class="locked">set.——</span></p>
<p>No matter for that, <i>Eugenius</i>; I would give the shirt off my
back to be burned into tinder, were it only to satisfy one feverish
enquirer, how many sparks at one good stroke, a good flint and
steel could strike into the tail of it.——Think ye not that
in striking these <i>in</i>,—he might, peradventure, strike
something <i>out?</i> as sure as a <span class="locked">gun.——</span></p>
<p>——But this project, by the bye.</p>
<p>The corporal sat up the best part of the night, in bringing
<i>his</i> to perfection; and having made a sufficient proof of his
cannon, with charging them to the top with tobacco,—he went with
contentment to bed.</p>
