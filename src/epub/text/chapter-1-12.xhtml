				<p>The <i>Mortgager</i> and <i>Mortgagée</i> differ the one from the other, not more in length of purse, than the <i>Jester</i> and <i>Jestée</i> do, in that of memory. But in this the comparison between them runs, as the scholiasts call it, upon all-four; which, by the bye, is upon one or two legs more than some of the best of <i>Homer’s</i> can pretend to;⁠—namely, That the one raises a sum, and the other a laugh at your expense, and thinks no more about it. Interest, however, still runs on in both cases;⁠—the periodical or accidental payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive; till, at length, in some evil hour,⁠—pop comes the creditor upon each, and by demanding principal upon the spot, together with full interest to the very day, makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations.</p>
				<p>As the reader (for I hate your <em>ifs</em>) has a thorough knowledge of human nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my <b>Hero</b> could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos. To speak the truth, he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book-debts of this stamp, which, notwithstanding <i>Eugenius’s</i> frequent advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was contracted thro’ any malignancy;⁠—but, on the contrary, from an honesty of mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be cross’d out in course.</p>
				<p><i>Eugenius</i> would never admit this; and would often tell him, that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would often add, in an accent of sorrowful apprehension,⁠—to the uttermost mite. To which <i>Yorick</i>, with his usual carelessness of heart, would as often answer with a pshaw!⁠—and if the subject was started in the fields⁠—with a hop, skip, and a jump at the end of it; but if close pent up in the social chimney-corner, where the culprit was barricado’d in, with a table and a couple of armchairs, and could not so readily fly off in a tangent,⁠—<i>Eugenius</i> would then go on with his lecture upon discretion in words to this purpose, though somewhat better put together.</p>
				<p>Trust me, dear <i>Yorick</i>, this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties, which no after-wit can extricate thee out of.⁠⸺⁠In these sallies, too oft, I see, it happens, that a person laughed at, considers himself in the light of a person injured, with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him; and when thou viewest him in that light too, and reckons up his friends, his family, his kindred and allies,⁠⸺⁠and musters up with them the many recruits which will list under him from a sense of common danger;⁠⸺’tis no extravagant arithmetick to say, that for every ten jokes,⁠—thou hast got an hundred enemies; and till thou hast gone on, and raised a swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half stung to death by them, thou wilt never be convinced it is so.</p>
				<p>I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these sallies⁠⸺⁠I believe and know them to be truly honest and sportive:⁠—But consider, my dear lad, that fools cannot distinguish this,⁠—and that knaves will not: and thou knowest not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry with the other:⁠⸺⁠whenever they associate for mutual defence, depend upon it, they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee, my dear friend, as to make thee heartily sick of it, and of thy life too.</p>
				<p>Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at thee, which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set right.⁠⸺⁠The fortunes of thy house shall totter,⁠—thy character, which led the way to them, shall bleed on every side of it,⁠—thy faith questioned,⁠—thy works belied,⁠—thy wit forgotten,⁠—thy learning trampled on. To wind up the last scene of thy tragedy, <b>Cruelty</b> and <b>Cowardice</b>, twin ruffians, hired and set on by <b>Malice</b> in the dark, shall strike together at all thy infirmities and mistakes:⁠⸺⁠The best of us, my dear lad, lie open there,⁠⸺⁠and trust me,⁠⸺⁠trust me, <i>Yorick</i>, <em>when to gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved upon, that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed, ’tis an easy matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with</em>.</p>
				<p><i>Yorick</i> scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to him, but with a fear stealing from his eye, and a promissory look attending it, that he was resolved, for the time to come, to ride his tit with more sobriety.⁠—But, alas, too late!⁠—a grand confederacy, with ***** and ***** at the head of it, was formed before the first prediction of it.⁠—The whole plan of the attack, just as <i>Eugenius</i> had foreboded, was put in execution all at once,⁠—with so little mercy on the side of the allies,⁠—and so little suspicion in <i>Yorick</i>, of what was carrying on against him,⁠—that when he thought, good easy man! full surely preferment was o’ ripening,⁠—they had smote his root, and then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before him.</p>
				<p><i>Yorick</i>, however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time; till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out at length by the calamities of the war,⁠—but more so, by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried on,⁠—he threw down the sword; and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the last, he died, nevertheless, as was generally thought, quite brokenhearted.</p>
				<p>What inclined <i>Eugenius</i> to the same opinion was as follows:</p>
				<p>A few hours before <i>Yorick</i> breathed his last, <i>Eugenius</i> stepped in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him. Upon his drawing <i>Yorick’s</i> curtain, and asking how he felt himself, <i>Yorick</i> looking up in his face took hold of his hand,⁠—and after thanking him for the many tokens of his friendship to him, for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet hereafter,⁠—he would thank him again and again,⁠—he told him, he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip forever.⁠—I hope not, answered <i>Eugenius</i>, with tears trickling down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke.⁠—I hope not, <i>Yorick</i>, said he.⁠⸺⁠<i>Yorick</i> replied, with a look up, and a gentle squeeze of <i>Eugenius’s</i> hand, and that was all,⁠—but it cut <i>Eugenius</i> to his heart,⁠—Come⁠—come, <i>Yorick</i>, quoth <i>Eugenius</i>, wiping his eyes, and summoning up the man within him,⁠—my dear lad, be comforted,⁠—let not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants them;⁠⸺⁠who knows what resources are in store, and what the power of God may yet do for thee?⁠⸺⁠<i>Yorick</i> laid his hand upon his heart, and gently shook his head;⁠—For my part, continued <i>Eugenius</i>, crying bitterly as he uttered the words,⁠—I declare I know not, <i>Yorick</i>, how to part with thee, and would gladly flatter my hopes, added <i>Eugenius</i>, chearing up his voice, that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop, and that I may live to see it.⁠⸺⁠I beseech thee, <i>Eugenius</i>, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, taking off his nightcap as well as he could with his left hand,⁠⸺⁠his right being still grasped close in that of <i>Eugenius</i>,⁠⸺⁠I beseech thee to take a view of my head.⁠—I see nothing that ails it, replied <i>Eugenius</i>. Then, alas! my friend, said <i>Yorick</i>, let me tell you, that ’tis so bruised and mis-shapened with the blows which ***** and *****, and some others have so unhandsomely given me, in the dark, that I might say with <i>Sancho Pança</i>, that should I recover, and “Mitres thereupon be suffered to rain down from heaven as thick as hail, not one of them would fit it.”⁠⸺⁠<i>Yorick’s</i> last breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this:⁠⸺⁠yet still it was uttered with something of a <i>Cervantick</i> tone;⁠⸺⁠and as he spoke it, <i>Eugenius</i> could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyes;⁠⸺⁠faint picture of those flashes of his spirit, which (as <i>Shakespeare</i> said of his ancestor) were wont to set the table in a roar!</p>
				<p><i>Eugenius</i> was convinced from this, that the heart of his friend was broke: he squeezed his hand,⁠⸺⁠and then walked softly out of the room, weeping as he walked. <i>Yorick</i> followed <i>Eugenius</i> with his eyes to the door,⁠—he then closed them,⁠—and never opened them more.</p>

				<p>He lies buried in the corner of his churchyard, in the parish of ⸻, under a plain marble slab, which his friend <i>Eugenius</i>, by leave of his executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than these three words of inscription, serving both for his epitaph and elegy.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Alas, poor <b>Yorick</b>!</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Ten times a day has <i>Yorick’s</i> ghost the consolation to hear his monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones, as denote a general pity and esteem for him;⁠⸺⁠a foot-way crossing the churchyard close by the side of his grave,⁠—not a passenger goes by without stopping to cast a look upon it,⁠—and sighing as he walks on,</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Alas, poor <b>Yorick</b>!</p>
				</blockquote>
