<p><span class="firstword">You</span> see ’tis high time, said my
father, addressing himself equally to my uncle <i>Toby</i> and
<i>Yorick</i>, to take this young creature out of these women’s hands,
and put him into those of a private governor. <i>Marcus Antoninus</i>
provided fourteen governors all at once to superintend his son
<i>Commodus’s</i> education,—and in six weeks he cashiered five of
them;—I know very well, continued my father, that
<i>Commodus’s</i> mother was in love with a gladiator at the time of her
conception, which accounts for a great many of <i>Commodus’s</i>
cruelties when he became emperor;—but still I am of opinion, that
those five whom <i>Antoninus</i> dismissed, did <i>Commodus’s</i>
temper, in that short time, more hurt than the other nine were able to
rectify all their lives long.</p>
<p>Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son, as the mirror
in which he is to view himself from morning to night, and by which he is
to adjust his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the inmost sentiments of
his heart;—I would have one, <i>Yorick</i>, if possible,
polished at all points, fit for my child to look into.——This
is very good sense, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i> to himself.</p>
<p>——There is, continued my father, a certain mien and
motion of the body and all its parts, both in acting and speaking, which
argues a man <i>well within</i>; and I am not at all surprised that
<i>Gregory</i> of <i>Nazianzum</i>, upon observing the hasty and
untoward gestures of <i>Julian</i>, should foretel he would one day
become an apostate;——or that St. <i>Ambrose</i> should turn
his <i>Amanuensis</i>
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page304" name="page304">304</a></span>
out of doors, because of an indecent motion of his head, which went
backwards and forwards like a flail;——or that
<i>Democritus</i> should conceive <i>Protagoras</i> to be a scholar,
from seeing him bind up a faggot, and thrusting, as he did it, the small
twigs inwards.——There are a thousand unnoticed openings,
continued my father, which let a penetrating eye at once into a man’s
soul; and I maintain it, added he, that a man of sense does not lay down
his hat in coming into a room,—or take it up in going out of it,
but something escapes, which discovers him.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons, continued my father, that the governor I
make choice of shall neither<a class="tag" href="#note_6_3" id="tag_6_3" name="tag_6_3">3</a> lisp, or squint, or wink, or talk
loud, or look fierce, or foolish;——or bite his lips, or
grind his teeth, or speak through his nose, or pick it, or blow it with
his <span class="locked">fingers.——</span></p>
<p>He shall neither walk fast,—or slow, or fold his
arms,—for that is laziness;—or hang them down,—for
that is folly; or hide them in his pocket, for that is <span class="locked">nonsense.——</span></p>
<p>He shall neither strike, or pinch, or tickle,—or bite, or cut
his nails, or hawk, or spit, or snift, or drum with his feet or fingers
in company;——nor (according to <i>Erasmus</i>) shall he
speak to any one in making water,—nor shall he point to carrion or
excrement.——Now this is all nonsense again, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i> to <span class="locked">himself.——</span></p>
<p>I will have him, continued my father, chearful, faceté, jovial; at
the same time, prudent, attentive to business, vigilant, acute, argute,
inventive, quick in resolving doubts and speculative
questions;——he shall be wise, and judicious, and
learned:——And why not humble, and moderate, and
gentle-tempered, and good? said <i>Yorick</i>:——And why not,
cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, free, and generous, and bountiful, and
brave?——He shall, my dear <i>Toby</i>, replied my father,
getting up and shaking him by the hand.—Then, brother
<i>Shandy</i>, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>, raising himself off the
chair, and laying down his pipe to take hold of my father’s other
hand,—I humbly beg I may recommend poor <i>Le Fever’s</i> son
to you;——a tear of joy of the first water sparkled in
my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> eye, and another, the fellow to it, in the
corporal’s, as the proposition was made;——you will see why
when you read <i>Le Fever’s</i> story:——fool that I was! nor
can I recollect (nor perhaps you) without turning back to the place,
what it was that hindered me from letting the corporal tell it in his
own words;—but the occasion is lost,—I must tell it now
in my own.</p>
