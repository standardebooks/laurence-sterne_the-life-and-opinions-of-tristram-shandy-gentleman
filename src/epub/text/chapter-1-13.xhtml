				<p>It is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted from the midwife, that it is high time to mention her again to him, merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world, and whom, upon the best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present,⁠—I am going to introduce to him for good and all: But as fresh matter may be started, and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself, which may require immediate dispatch;⁠——’twas right to take care that the poor woman should not be lost in the meantime;⁠—because when she is wanted, we can no way do without her.</p>
				<p>I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note and consequence throughout our whole village and township;⁠—that her fame had spread itself to the very out-edge and circumference of that circle of importance, of which kind every soul living, whether he has a shirt to his back or no,⁠——has one surrounding him;⁠—which said circle, by the way, whenever ’tis said that such a one is of great weight and importance in the <em>world</em>,⁠——I desire may be enlarged or contracted in your worship’s fancy, in a compound ratio of the station, profession, knowledge, abilities, height and depth (measuring both ways) of the personage brought before you.</p>
				<p>In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it about four or five miles, which not only comprehended the whole parish, but extended itself to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish; which made a considerable thing of it. I must add, That she was, moreover, very well looked on at one large grange-house, and some other odd houses and farms within two or three miles, as I said, from the smoke of her own chimney:⁠——But I must here, once for all, inform you, that all this will be more exactly delineated and explain’d in a map, now in the hands of the engraver, which, with many other pieces and developements of this work, will be added to the end of the twentieth volume,⁠—not to swell the work,⁠—I detest the thought of such a thing;⁠—but by way of commentary, scholium, illustration, and key to such passages, incidents, or innuendos as shall be thought to be either of private interpretation, or of dark or doubtful meaning, after my life and my opinions shall have been read over (now don’t forget the meaning of the word) by all the <em>world</em>;⁠——which, betwixt you and me, and in spite of all the gentlemen-reviewers in <i>Great Britain</i>, and of all that their worships shall undertake to write or say to the contrary,⁠—I am determined shall be the case.⁠—I need not tell your worship, that all this is spoke in confidence.</p>
