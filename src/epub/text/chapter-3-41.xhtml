<p><span class="firstword">’Tis</span> a pity, cried my father one
winter’s night, after a three hours’ painful translation of
<i>Slawkenbergius</i>——’tis a pity, cried
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page173" name="page173">173</a></span>
my father, putting my mother’s thread-paper into the book for a mark, as
he spoke——that truth, brother <i>Toby</i>, should shut
herself up in such impregnable fastnesses, and be so obstinate as not to
surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest <span class="locked">siege.——</span></p>
<p>Now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that my
uncle <i>Toby’s</i> fancy, during the time of my father’s explanation of
<i>Prignitz</i> to him———having nothing to stay it
there, had taken a short flight to the
bowling-green!———his body might as well have taken a
turn there too—so that with all the semblance of a deep school-man
intent upon the <i>medius terminus</i>———my uncle
<i>Toby</i> was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture, and all its
pros and cons, as if my father had been translating <i>Hafen
Slawkenbergius</i> from the <i>Latin</i> tongue into the
<i>Cherokee</i>. But the word <i>siege</i>, like a talismanic power, in
my father’s metaphor, wafting back my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> fancy, quick
as a note could follow the touch—he open’d his
ears——and my father observing that he took his pipe out of
his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with a desire to
profit—my father with great pleasure began his sentence
again——changing only the plan, and dropping the metaphor of
the siege of it, to keep clear of some dangers my father apprehended
from it.</p>
<p>’Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one side,
brother <i>Toby</i>———considering what ingenuity these
learned men have all shewn in their solutions of noses.——Can
noses be dissolved? replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
<p>———My father thrust back his
chair———rose up—put on his
hat———took four long strides to the
door———jerked it open——thrust his head
half way out——shut the door again——took no
notice of the bad hinge——returned to the table—pluck’d
my mother’s thread-paper out of <i>Slawkenbergius’s</i>
book———went hastily to his bureau—walked slowly
back—twisted my mother’s thread-paper about his
thumb—unbutton’d his waistcoat—threw my mother’s
thread-paper into the fire——bit her sattin pin-cushion in
two, fill’d his mouth with bran—confounded it;—but
mark!—the oath of confusion was levell’d at my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
brain—which was e’en confused enough already——the
curse came charged only with the bran—the bran, may it please your
honours, was no more than powder to the ball.</p>
<p>’Twas well my father’s passions lasted not long; for so long as they
did last, they led him a busy life on’t; and it is one of the most
unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations of human
nature, that nothing should prove my father’s
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page174" name="page174">174</a></span>
mettle so much, or make his passions go off so like gunpowder, as the
unexpected strokes his science met with from the quaint simplicity of my
uncle <i>Toby’s</i> questions.——Had ten dozen of hornets
stung him behind in so many different places all at one time—he
could not have exerted more mechanical functions in fewer
seconds———or started half so much, as with one single
<i>quære</i> of three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his
hobby-horsical career.</p>
<p>’Twas all one to my uncle <i>Toby</i>———he smoaked
his pipe on with unvaried composure——his heart never
intended offence to his brother—and as his head could seldom find
out where the sting of it lay——he always gave my father the
credit of cooling by himself.——He was five minutes and
thirty-five seconds about it in the present case.</p>
<p>By all that’s good! said my father, swearing, as he came to himself,
and taking the oath out of <i>Ernulphus’s</i> digest of
curses——(though to do my father justice it was a fault
(as he told Dr. <i>Slop</i> in the affair of <i>Ernulphus</i>)
which he as seldom committed as any man upon
earth)———By all that’s good and great! brother
<i>Toby</i>, said my father, if it was not for the aids of philosophy,
which befriend one so much as they do—you would put a man beside
all temper.——Why, by the <i>solutions</i> of noses, of which
I was telling you, I meant, as you might have known, had you
favoured me with one grain of attention, the various accounts which
learned men of different kinds of knowledge have given the world of the
causes of short and long noses.——There is no cause but one,
replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>——why one man’s nose is longer
than another’s, but because that God pleases to have it
so.——That is <i>Grangousier’s</i> solution, said my
father.—’Tis he, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking up, and
not regarding my father’s interruption, who makes us all, and frames and
puts us together in such forms and proportions, and for such ends, as is
agreeable to his infinite wisdom.——’Tis a pious account,
cried my father, but not philosophical——there is more
religion in it than sound science. ’Twas no inconsistent part of my
uncle <i>Toby’s</i> character——that he feared God, and
reverenced religion.——So the moment my father finished his
remark——my uncle <i>Toby</i> fell a whistling
<i>Lillabullero</i> with more zeal (though more out of tune) than <span class="locked">usual.—</span></p>
<p>What is become of my wife’s thread-paper?</p>
