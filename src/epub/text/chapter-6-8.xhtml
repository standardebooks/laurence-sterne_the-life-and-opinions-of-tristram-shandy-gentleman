<h5>THE STORY OF LE FEVER CONTINUED</h5>
<p class="normal">
<span class="firstword">It</span> was to my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
eternal honour,——though I tell it only for the sake of
those, who, when coop’d in betwixt a natural and a positive law, know
not, for their souls, which way in the world to turn
themselves——That notwithstanding my uncle <i>Toby</i> was
warmly engaged at that time in carrying on the siege of
<i>Dendermond</i>, parallel with the allies, who pressed theirs on so
vigorously, that they scarce allowed him time to get his
dinner——that nevertheless he gave up <i>Dendermond</i>,
though he had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp;—and
bent his whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn; and
except that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up, by which he
might be said to have turned the siege of <i>Dendermond</i> into a
blockade,—he left <i>Dendermond</i> to itself—to be relieved
or not by the <i>French</i> king, as the <i>French</i> king thought
good; and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor
lieutenant and his son.</p>
<p>——That kind <span class="smallcaps">Being</span>, who
is a friend to the friendless, shall recompence thee for this.</p>
<p>Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle <i>Toby</i> to the
corporal, as he was putting him to bed,——and I will tell
thee in what, <i>Trim</i>.——In the first place, when thou
madest an offer of my services to <i>Le Fever</i>,——as
sickness and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but
a poor lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his
pay,—that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse;
because, had he stood in need, thou knowest, <i>Trim</i>, he had been as
welcome to it as myself.——Your honour knows, said the
corporal, I had no orders;——True, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,—thou didst very right, <i>Trim</i>, as a
soldier,—but certainly very wrong as a man.</p>
<p>In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same excuse,
continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>,——when thou offeredst him
whatever was in my house,——thou shouldst have offered him my
house too:——A sick brother officer should have the best
quarters, <i>Trim</i>, and if we had him with us,—we could tend
and look to him:——Thou art an excellent nurse thyself,
<i>Trim</i>,—and what with thy care of him, and the old woman’s,
and his boy’s, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once,
and set him upon his <span class="locked">legs.———</span></p>
<p>——In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, smiling,——he might march.——He will
never march; an’ please your honour, in this world, said the
corporal:——He will march; said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, rising
up, from the side of the bed, with one shoe off:——An’ please
your honour, said the corporal, he will never march but to his
grave:——He shall march, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, marching
the foot which had a shoe on, though without advancing an inch,—he
shall march to his regiment.——He cannot stand it, said the
corporal;——He shall be supported, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>;——He’ll drop at last, said the corporal, and
what will become of his boy?——He shall not drop, said my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, firmly.——A-well-o’-day,—do what we
can for him, said <i>Trim</i>, maintaining his point,—the poor
soul will die:——He shall not die, by G—, cried my
uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
<p>—The <span class="smallroman">ACCUSING SPIRIT</span>, which
flew up to heaven’s chancery with the oath, blush’d as he gave it
in;—and the <span class="smallroman">RECORDING ANGEL</span>, as
he wrote it down, dropp’d a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for
ever.</p>
