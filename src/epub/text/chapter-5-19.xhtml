				<p> a pity, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, resting with his hand upon the corporal’s shoulder, as they both stood surveying their works,⁠—that we have not a couple of field-pieces to mount in the gorge of that new redoubt;⁠——’twould secure the lines all along there, and make the attack on that side quite complete:⁠——get me a couple cast, <i>Trim</i>.</p>
				<p>Your honour shall have them, replied <i>Trim</i>, before to-morrow morning.</p>
				<p>It was the joy of <i>Trim’s</i> heart,⁠—nor was his fertile head ever at a loss for expedients in doing it, to supply my uncle <i>Toby</i> in his campaigns, with whatever his fancy called for; had it been his last crown, he would have sate down and hammered it into a paderero, to have prevented a single wish in his Master. The corporal had already,⁠—what with cutting off the ends of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> spouts⁠—hacking and chiseling up the sides of his leaden gutters,⁠—melting down his pewter shaving-bason,⁠—and going at last, like <i>Lewis</i> the Fourteenth, on to the top of the church, for spare ends, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠——he had that very campaign brought no less than eight new battering cannons, besides three demi-culverins, into the field; my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> demand for two more pieces for the redoubt, had set the corporal at work again; and no better resource offering, he had taken the two leaden weights from the nursery window: and as the sash pullies, when the lead was gone, were of no kind of use, he had taken them away also, to make a couple of wheels for one of their carriages.</p>
				<p>He had dismantled every sash-window in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> house long before, in the very same way,⁠—though not always in the same order; for sometimes the pullies have been wanted, and not the lead,⁠—so then he began with the pullies,⁠—and the pullies being picked out, then the lead became useless,⁠—and so the lead went to pot too.</p>
				<p>——A great <strong>moral</strong> might be picked handsomely out of this, but I have not time⁠—’tis enough to say, wherever the demolition began, ’twas equally fatal to the sash window.</p>
