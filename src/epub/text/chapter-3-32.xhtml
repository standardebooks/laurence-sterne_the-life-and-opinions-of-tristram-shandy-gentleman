<p>——“<span class="firstword">Because</span>,” quoth my
great-grandmother, repeating the words again—“you have little or
no nose, <span class="locked">Sir.”———</span></p>
<p>S’death! cried my great-grandfather, clapping his hand upon his
nose,—’tis not so small as that comes to;——’tis a full
inch longer than my father’s.—Now, my great-grandfather’s nose was
for all the world like unto the noses of all the men, women, and
children, whom <i>Pantagruel</i> found dwelling upon the island of <span class="smallcaps">Ennasin</span>.———By the way, if
you would know the strange way of getting a-kin amongst so flat-nosed a
people——you must read the book;——find it out
yourself, you never <span class="locked">can.——</span></p>
<p>—’Twas shaped, Sir, like an ace of clubs.</p>
<p>—’Tis a full inch, continued my grandfather, pressing up the
ridge of his nose with his finger and thumb; and repeating his
assertion——’tis a full inch longer, madam, than my
father’s——You must mean your uncle’s, replied my
great-grandmother.</p>
<p>———My great-grandfather was convinced.—He
untwisted the paper, and signed the article.</p>
