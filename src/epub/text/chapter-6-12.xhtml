<p><span class="firstword">When</span> my uncle <i>Toby</i> had turned
everything into money, and settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the
regiment and <i>Le Fever</i>, and betwixt <i>Le Fever</i> and all
mankind,——there remained nothing more in my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> hands, than an old regimental coat and a sword; so that my
uncle <i>Toby</i> found little or no opposition from the world in taking
administration. The coat my uncle <i>Toby</i> gave the
corporal;——Wear it, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
as long as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor
lieutenant——And this,——said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, taking up the sword in his hand, and drawing it out of the
scabbard as he spoke——and this, <i>Le Fever</i>, I’ll save
for thee,—’tis all the fortune, continued my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
hanging it up upon a crook, and pointing to it,—’tis all the
fortune, my dear <i>Le Fever</i>, which God has left thee; but if he has
given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world,—and thou
doest it like a man of honour,—’tis enough for us.</p>
<p>As soon as my uncle <i>Toby</i> had laid a foundation, and taught him
to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public
school, where, excepting <i>Whitsontide</i> and <i>Christmas</i>, at
which times the corporal was punctually dispatched for him,—he
remained to the spring of the year, seventeen; when the stories of the
emperor’s sending his army into <i>Hungary</i> against the <i>Turks</i>,
kindling a spark of fire in his bosom, he left his <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Latin</i> without leave, and throwing himself upon his knees before
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, begged his father’s sword, and my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> leave along with it, to go and try his fortune under
<i>Eugene</i>.—Twice did my uncle <i>Toby</i> forget his wound and
cry out, <i>Le Fever!</i> I will go with thee, and thou shalt fight
beside me——And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and
hung down his head in sorrow and <span class="locked">disconsolation.——</span></p>
<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> took down the sword from the crook, where
it had hung untouched ever since the lieutenant’s death, and delivered
it to the corporal to brighten up;——and having detained
<i>Le Fever</i> a single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his
passage to <i>Leghorn</i>,—he put the sword into his
hand.——If thou art brave, <i>Le Fever</i>, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, this will not fail thee,——but Fortune, said he
(musing a little),——Fortune may——And if she
does,—added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, embracing him, come back again
to me, <i>Le Fever</i>, and we will shape thee another course.</p>
<p>The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of <i>Le
Fever</i> more than my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> paternal
kindness;——he parted from my uncle <i>Toby</i>, as the best
of sons from the best of fathers——both dropped
tears——and as my uncle <i>Toby</i> gave him his last kiss,
he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his father’s, in
which was his mother’s ring, into his hand,——and bid God
bless him.</p>
