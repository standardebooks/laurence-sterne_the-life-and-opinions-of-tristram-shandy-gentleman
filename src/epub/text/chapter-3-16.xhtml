				<p>—Upon my honour, Sir, you have tore every bit of skin quite off the back of both my hands with your forceps, cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>—and you have crush’d all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a jelly. ’Tis your own fault, said Dr. <i>Slop</i>——you should have clinch’d your two fists together into the form of a child’s head as I told you, and sat firm. I did so, answered my uncle <i>Toby</i>.——Then the points of my forceps have not been sufficiently arm’d, or the rivet wants closing—or else the cut in my thumb has made me a little aukward—or possibly—’Tis well, quoth my father, interrupting the detail of possibilities—that the experiment was not first made upon my child’s head-piece.———It would not have been a cherry-stone the worse, answered Dr. <i>Slop</i>.—I maintain it, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, it would have broke the cerebellum (unless indeed the skull had been as hard as a granado) and turn’d it all into a perfect posset.———Pshaw! replied Dr. <i>Slop</i>, a child’s head is naturally as soft as the pap of an apple;—the sutures give way—and besides, I could have extracted by the feet after.—Not you, said she.——I rather wish you would begin that way, quoth my father.</p>
				<p>Pray do, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
