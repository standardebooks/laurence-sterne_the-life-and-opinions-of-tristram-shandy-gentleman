				<p>—If you have any objection,⁠—said my father, addressing himself to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>. Not in the least, replied <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>;⁠—for it does not appear on which side of the question it is wrote;⁠⸺⁠it may be a composition of a divine of our church, as well as yours,⁠—so that we run equal risques.⁠⸺’Tis wrote upon neither side, quoth <i>Trim</i>, for ’tis only upon <em>Conscience</em>, an’ please your Honours.</p>
				<p><i>Trim’s</i> reason put his audience into good-humour,⁠—all but <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>, who turning his head about towards <i>Trim</i>, looked a little angry.</p>
				<p>Begin, <i>Trim</i>,⁠—and read distinctly, quoth my father.⁠—I will, an’ please your Honour, replied the Corporal, making a bow, and bespeaking attention with a slight movement of his right hand.</p>
