				<p>I had now the whole south of <i>France</i>, from the banks of the <i>Rhône</i> to those of the <i>Garonne</i>, to traverse upon my mule at my own leisure—<i>at my own leisure</i>——for I had left Death, the Lord knows——and He only—how far behind me——“I have followed many a man thro’ <i>France</i>, quoth he—but never at this mettlesome rate.”——Still he followed,——and still I fled him——but I fled him chearfully——still he pursued——but, like one who pursued his prey without hope——as he lagg’d, every step he lost, soften’d his looks——why should I fly him at this rate?</p>
				<p>So notwithstanding all the commissary of the post-office had said, I changed the <i>mode</i> of my travelling once more; and, after so precipitate and rattling a course as I had run, I flattered my fancy with thinking of my mule, and that I should traverse the rich plains of <i>Languedoc</i> upon his back, as slowly as foot could fall.</p>
				<p>There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller——or more terrible to travel-writers, than a large rich plain; especially if it is without great rivers or bridges; and presents nothing to the eye, but one unvaried picture of plenty: for after they have once told you, that ’tis delicious! or delightful! (as the case happens)—that the soil was grateful, and that nature pours out all her abundance, &amp;c. . . . they have then a large plain upon their hands, which they know not what to do with—and which is of little or no use to them but to carry them to some town; and that town, perhaps of little more, but a new place to start from to the next plain——and so on.</p>
				<p>—This is most terrible work; judge if I don’t manage my plains better.</p>
