			<p>Fifty thousand pannier loads of devils⁠—(not of the Archbishop of <i>Benevento’s</i>,⁠—I mean of <i>Rabelais’s</i> devils) with their tails chopped off by their rumps, could not have made so diabolical a scream of it, as I did⁠—when the accident befell me: it summoned up my mother instantly into the nursery,⁠—so that <i>Susannah</i> had but just time to make her escape down the back stairs, as my mother came up the fore.</p>
			<p>Now, though I was old enough to have told the story myself,⁠—and young enough, I hope, to have done it without malignity; yet <i>Susannah</i>, in passing by the kitchen, for fear of accidents, had left it in shorthand with the cook⁠—the cook had told it with a commentary to <i>Jonathan</i>, and <i>Jonathan</i> to <i>Obadiah</i>; so that by the time my father had rung the bell half a dozen times, to know what was the matter above,⁠—was <i>Obadiah</i> enabled to give him a particular account of it, just as it had happened.⁠—I thought as much, said my father, tucking up his nightgown;⁠—and so walked upstairs.</p>
			<p>One would imagine from this⁠⸺(though for my own part I somewhat question it)⁠—that my father, before that time, had actually wrote that remarkable character in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Tristra-pædia</i>, which to me is the most original and entertaining one in the whole book;⁠—and that is the <em>chapter upon sash-windows</em>, with a bitter <i>Philippick</i> at the end of it, upon the forgetfulness of chambermaids.⁠—I have but two reasons for thinking otherwise.</p>
			<p>First, Had the matter been taken into consideration, before the event happened, my father certainly would have nailed up the sash window for good an’ all;⁠—which, considering with what difficulty he composed books,⁠—he might have done with ten times less trouble, than he could have wrote the chapter: this argument I foresee holds good against his writing a chapter, even after the event; but ’tis obviated under the second reason, which I have the honour to offer to the world in support of my opinion, that my father did not write the chapter upon sash-windows and chamberpots, at the time supposed,⁠—and it is this.</p>
			<p>⸺⁠That, in order to render the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Tristra-pædia</i> complete,⁠—I wrote the chapter myself.</p>
