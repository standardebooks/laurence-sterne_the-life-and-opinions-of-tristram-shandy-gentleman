				<p><span class="firstword">My</span> uncle <i>Toby</i> took the ivory pipe out of the corporal’s hand,—looked at it for half a minute, and returned it.</p>
				<p>In less than two minutes, my uncle <i>Toby</i> took the pipe from the corporal again, and raised it half way to his mouth——then hastily gave it back a second time.</p>
				<p>The corporal redoubled the attack,——my uncle <i>Toby</i> smiled,——then looked grave,——then smiled for a moment,——then looked serious for a long time;——Give me hold of the ivory pipe, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>——my uncle <i>Toby</i> put it to his lips,——drew it back directly,—gave a peep over the horn-beam hedge;——never did my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> mouth water so much for a pipe in his life.——My uncle <i>Toby</i> retired into the sentry-box with the pipe in his <span class="locked">hand.———</span></p>
				<p>——Dear uncle <i>Toby!</i> don’t go into the sentry-box with the pipe,—there’s no trusting a man’s self with such a thing in such a corner.</p>
