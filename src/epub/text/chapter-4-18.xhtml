<p><span class="firstword">Your</span> honour, said <i>Trim</i>,
shutting the parlour-door before he began to speak, has heard,
I imagine, of this unlucky accident——O yes,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and it gives me great
concern.—I am heartily concerned too, but I hope your honour,
replied <i>Trim</i>, will do me the justice to believe, that it was not
in the least owing to me.——To
thee—<i>Trim?</i>—cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking kindly
in his face———’twas <i>Susannah’s</i> and the curate’s
folly betwixt them.———What business could they have
together, an’ please your honour, in the garden?——In the
gallery thou meanest, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
<p><i>Trim</i> found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short with a
low bow——Two misfortunes, quoth the corporal to himself, are
twice as many at least as are needful to be talked over at one
time;——the mischief the cow has done in breaking into the
fortifications, may be told his honour
hereafter.——<i>Trim’s</i> casuistry and address, under the
cover of his low bow, prevented all suspicion in my uncle <i>Toby</i>,
so he went on with what he had to say to <i>Trim</i> as follows:</p>
<p>———For my own part, <i>Trim</i>, though I can see
little or no difference betwixt my nephew’s being called <i>Tristram</i>
or <i>Trismegistus</i>—yet as the thing sits so near my brother’s
heart, <i>Trim</i>———I would freely have given a
hundred pounds rather than it should have
happened.——A hundred pounds, an’ please your honour!
replied <i>Trim</i>,——I would not give a cherry-stone
to boot.——Nor would I, <i>Trim</i>, upon my own
account, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>,————but my
brother, whom there is no arguing
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page214" name="page214">214</a></span>
with in this case—maintains that a great deal more depends,
<i>Trim</i>, upon christian-names, than what ignorant people
imagine——for he says there never was a great or heroic
action performed since the world began by one called
<i>Tristram</i>—nay, he will have it, <i>Trim</i>, that a man can
neither be learned, or wise, or brave.——’Tis all fancy, an’
please your honour—I fought just as well, replied the
corporal, when the regiment called me <i>Trim</i>, as when they called
me <i>James Butler</i>.——And for my own part, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, though I should blush to boast of myself,
<i>Trim</i>——yet had my name been <i>Alexander</i>,
I could have done no more at <i>Namur</i> than my duty.—Bless
your honour! cried <i>Trim</i>, advancing three steps as he spoke, does
a man think of his christian-name when he goes upon the
attack?———Or when he stands in the trench,
<i>Trim?</i> cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking firm.——Or
when he enters a breach? said <i>Trim</i>, pushing in between two
chairs.——Or forces the lines? cried my uncle, rising up, and
pushing his crutch like a pike.——Or facing a platoon? cried
<i>Trim</i>, presenting his stick like a fire-lock.——Or when
he marches up the glacis? cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking warm and
setting his foot upon his <span class="locked">stool.———</span></p>
