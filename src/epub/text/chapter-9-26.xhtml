			<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XXVI</h3>
			<p>It is natural for a perfect stranger who is going from <i>London</i> to <i>Edinburgh</i>, to enquire before he sets out, how many miles to <i>York</i>; which is about the halfway⁠⸺⁠nor does anybody wonder, if he goes on and asks about the corporation, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—</p>
			<p>It was just as natural for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i>, whose first husband was all his time afflicted with a Sciatica, to wish to know how far from the hip to the groin; and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in her feelings, in the one case than in the other.</p>
			<p>She had accordingly read <i>Drake’s</i> anatomy from one end to the other. She had peeped into <i>Wharton</i> upon the brain, and borrowed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a> <i>Graaf</i> upon the bones and muscles; but could make nothing of it.</p>
			<p>She had reason’d likewise from her own powers⁠⸺⁠laid down theorems⁠⸺⁠drawn consequences, and come to no conclusion.</p>
			<p>To clear up all, she had twice asked Doctor <i>Slop</i>, “if poor captain <i>Shandy</i> was ever likely to recover of his wound⁠⸺?”</p>
			<p>⸺⁠He is recovered, Doctor <i>Slop</i> would say⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>What! quite?</p>
			<p>Quite: madam⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>But what do you mean by a recovery? <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> would say.</p>
			<p>Doctor <i>Slop</i> was the worst man alive at definitions; and so <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> could get no knowledge: in short, there was no way to extract it, but from my uncle <i>Toby</i> himself.</p>
			<p>There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which lulls <b>Suspicion</b> to rest⁠⸺⁠and I am half persuaded the serpent got pretty near it, in his discourse with Eve; for the propensity in the sex to be deceived could not be so great, that she should have boldness to hold chat with the devil, without it⁠⸺⁠But there is an accent of humanity⁠⸺⁠how shall I describe it?⁠—’tis an accent which covers the part with a garment, and gives the enquirer a right to be as particular with it, as your body-surgeon.</p>
			<p>“⁠⸺⁠Was it without remission?⁠—</p>
			<p>“⁠⸺⁠Was it more tolerable in bed?</p>
			<p>“⁠⸺⁠Could he lie on both sides alike with it?</p>
			<p>“⁠—Was he able to mount a horse?</p>
			<p>“⁠—Was motion bad for it?” et cetera, were so tenderly spoke to, and so directed towards my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> heart, that every item of them sunk ten times deeper into it than the evils themselves⁠⸺⁠but when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> went round about by <i>Namur</i> to get at my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> groin; and engaged him to attack the point of the advanced counterscarp, and pêle mêle with the <i>Dutch</i> to take the counterguard of <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Roch</i> sword in hand⁠—and then with tender notes playing upon his ear, led him all bleeding by the hand out of the trench, wiping her eye, as he was carried to his tent⁠⸺⁠Heaven! Earth! Sea!⁠—all was lifted up⁠—the springs of nature rose above their levels⁠—an angel of mercy sat besides him on the sofa⁠—his heart glow’d with fire⁠—and had he been worth a thousand, he had lost every heart of them to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i>.</p>
			<p>—And whereabouts, dear Sir, quoth <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i>, a little categorically, did you receive this sad blow?⁠⸺⁠In asking this question, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> gave a slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> red plush breeches, expecting naturally, as the shortest reply to it, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> would lay his forefinger upon the place⁠⸺⁠It fell out otherwise⁠⸺⁠for my uncle <i>Toby</i> having got his wound before the gate of <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Nicolas</i>, in one of the traverses of the trench opposite to the salient angle of the demibastion of <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Roch</i>; he could at any time stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing when the stone struck him: this struck instantly upon my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> sensorium⁠⸺⁠and with it, struck his large map of the town and citadel of <i>Namur</i> and its environs, which he had purchased and pasted down upon a board, by the corporal’s aid, during his long illness⁠⸺⁠it had lain with other military lumber in the garret ever since, and accordingly the corporal was detached into the garret to fetch it.</p>
			<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> measured off thirty toises, with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman’s</i> scissors, from the returning angle before the gate of <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Nicolas</i>; and with such a virgin modesty laid her finger upon the place, that the goddess of Decency, if then in being⁠—if not, ’twas her shade⁠—shook her head, and with a finger wavering across her eyes⁠—forbid her to explain the mistake.</p>
			<p>Unhappy <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman!</i></p>
			<p>⸺⁠For nothing can make this chapter go off with spirit but an apostrophe to thee⁠⸺⁠but my heart tells me, that in such a crisis an apostrophe is but an insult in disguise, and ere I would offer one to a woman in distress⁠—let the chapter go to the devil; provided any damn’d critic <em>in keeping</em> will be but at the trouble to take it with him.</p>
