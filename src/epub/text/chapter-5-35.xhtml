			<p>“The two great causes, which conspire with each other to shorten life, says lord <i>Verulam</i>, are first⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>“The internal spirit, which, like a gentle flame, wastes the body down to death:⁠—And secondly, the external air, that parches the body up to ashes:⁠—which two enemies attacking us on both sides of our bodies together, at length destroy our organs, and render them unfit to carry on the functions of life.”</p>
			<p>This being the state of the case, the road to Longevity was plain; nothing more being required, says his lordship, but to repair the waste committed by the internal spirit, by making the substance of it more thick and dense, by a regular course of opiates on one side, and by refrigerating the heat of it on the other, by three grains and a half of saltpetre every morning before you got up.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical assaults of the air without;⁠—but this was fenced off again by a course of greasy unctions, which so fully saturated the pores of the skin, that no spicula could enter;⁠⸺⁠nor could any one get out.⁠⸺⁠This put a stop to all perspiration, sensible and insensible, which being the cause of so many scurvy distempers⁠—a course of clysters was requisite to carry off redundant humours,⁠—and render the system complete.</p>
			<p>What my father had to say to my lord of <i>Verulam’s</i> opiates, his saltpetre, and greasy unctions and clysters, you shall read,⁠—but not today⁠—or tomorrow: time presses upon me,⁠—my reader is impatient⁠—I must get forwards.⁠⸺⁠You shall read the chapter at your leisure (if you choose it), as soon as ever the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Tristra-paedia</i> is published.⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p>Sufficeth it at present, to say, my father levelled the hypothesis with the ground, and in doing that, the learned know, he built up and established his own.⁠⸺⁠</p>
