				<p>My father’s collection was not great, but to make amends, it was curious; and consequently he was some time in making it; he had the great good fortune however, to set off well, in getting <i>Bruscambille’s</i> prologue upon long noses, almost for nothing⁠—for he gave no more for <i>Bruscambille</i> than three half-crowns; owing indeed to the strong fancy which the stall-man saw my father had for the book the moment he laid his hands upon it.⁠⸺There are not three <i>Bruscambilles</i> in <i>Christendom</i>⁠—said the stall-man, except what are chain’d up in the libraries of the curious. My father flung down the money as quick as lightning⁠⸺took <i>Bruscambille</i> into his bosom⁠⸺hied home from <i>Piccadilly</i> to <i>Coleman</i>-street with it, as he would have hied home with a treasure, without taking his hand once off from <i>Bruscambille</i> all the way.</p>
				<p>To those who do not yet know of which gender <i>Bruscambille</i> is⁠⸻inasmuch as a prologue upon long noses might easily be done by either⁠⸻’twill be no objection against the simile⁠—to say, That when my father got home, he solaced himself with <i>Bruscambille</i> after the manner in which, ’tis ten to one, your worship solaced yourself with your first mistress⁠⸻that is, from morning even unto night: which, by the bye, how delightful soever it may prove to the inamorato⁠—is of little or no entertainment at all to bystanders.⁠⸺Take notice, I go no farther with the simile⁠—my father’s eye was greater than his appetite⁠—his zeal greater than his knowledge⁠—he cool’d⁠—his affections became divided⁠⸺he got hold of <i>Prignitz</i>⁠—purchased <i>Scroderus</i>, <i>Andrea Paræus</i>, <i>Bouchet’s</i> Evening Conferences, and above all, the great and learned <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>; of which, as I shall have much to say by and by⁠—I will say nothing now.</p>
