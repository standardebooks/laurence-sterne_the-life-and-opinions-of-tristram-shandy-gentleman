				<p>The world is ashamed of being virtuous⁠⸺My uncle <i>Toby</i> knew little of the world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow <i>Wadman</i>, he had no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of, than if <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> had given him a cut with a gap’d knife across his finger: Had it been otherwise⁠⸺yet as he ever look’d upon <i>Trim</i> as a humble friend; and saw fresh reasons every day of his life, to treat him as such⁠⸺it would have made no variation in the manner in which he informed him of the affair.</p>
