				<p>When Corporal <i>Trim</i> had brought his two mortars to bear, he was delighted with his handy-work above measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying them directly into his parlour.</p>
				<p>Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the affair of <em>hinges</em>, I had a speculative consideration arising out of it, and it is this.</p>
				<p>Had the parlour door opened and turn’d upon its hinges, as a door should do⁠—</p>
				<p>Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been turning upon its hinges⁠⸺(that is, in case things have all along gone well with your worship,⁠—otherwise I give up my simile)⁠—in this case, I say, there had been no danger either to master or man, in Corporal <i>Trim’s</i> peeping in: the moment he had beheld my father and my uncle <i>Toby</i> fast asleep⁠—the respectfulness of his carriage was such, he would have retired as silent as death, and left them both in their armchairs, dreaming as happy as he had found them: but the thing was, morally speaking, so very impracticable, that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to upon its account⁠—this was one; that he never folded his arms to take his nap after dinner, but the thoughts of being unavoidably awakened by the first person who should open the door, was always uppermost in his imagination, and so incessantly stepp’d in betwixt him and the first balmy presage of his repose, as to rob him, as he often declared, of the whole sweets of it.</p>
				<p>“<em>When things move upon bad hinges</em>, an’ please your lordships, <em>how can it be otherwise?</em>”</p>
				<p>Pray what’s the matter? Who is there? cried my father, waking, the moment the door began to creak.⁠⸺I wish the smith would give a peep at that confounded hinge.⁠⸺’Tis nothing, an’ please your honour, said <i>Trim</i>, but two mortars I am bringing in.⁠—They shan’t make a clatter with them here, cried my father hastily.⁠—If <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> has any drugs to pound, let him do it in the kitchen.⁠—May it please your honour, cried <i>Trim</i>, they are two mortar-pieces for a siege next summer, which I have been making out of a pair of jackboots, which <i>Obadiah</i> told me your honour had left off wearing.⁠—By Heaven! cried my father, springing out of his chair, as he swore⁠⸺I have not one appointment belonging to me, which I set so much store by as I do by these jackboots⁠⸺they were our great grandfather’s, brother <i>Toby</i>⁠—they were <em>hereditary</em>. Then I fear, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, <i>Trim</i> has cut off the entail.⁠—I have only cut off the tops, an’ please your honour, cried <i>Trim</i>⁠⸺I hate <em>perpetuities</em> as much as any man alive, cried my father⁠⸺but these jackboots, continued he (smiling, though very angry at the same time) have been in the family, brother, ever since the civil wars;⁠⸺Sir <i>Roger Shandy</i> wore them at the battle of <i>Marston-Moor</i>.⁠—I declare I would not have taken ten pounds for them.⁠⸺I’ll pay you the money, brother <i>Shandy</i>, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, looking at the two mortars with infinite pleasure, and putting his hand into his breeches pocket as he viewed them⁠⸺I’ll pay you the ten pounds this moment with all my heart and soul.⁠⸺</p>
				<p>Brother <i>Toby</i>, replied my father, altering his tone, you care not what money you dissipate and throw away, provided, continued he, ’tis but upon a <strong>siege</strong>.⁠⸺Have I not one hundred and twenty pounds a year, besides my half pay? cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠—What is that⁠—replied my father hastily⁠—to ten pounds for a pair of jackboots?⁠—twelve guineas for your <em>pontoons?</em>⁠—half as much for your <i>Dutch</i> drawbridge?⁠—to say nothing of the train of little brass artillery you bespoke last week, with twenty other preparations for the siege of <i>Messina</i>: believe me, dear brother <i>Toby</i>, continued my father, taking him kindly by the hand⁠—these military operations of yours are above your strength;⁠—you mean well, brother⁠⸺but they carry you into greater expenses than you were first aware of;⁠—and take my word, dear <i>Toby</i>, they will in the end quite ruin your fortune, and make a beggar of you.⁠—What signifies it if they do, brother, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, so long as we know ’tis for the good of the nation?⁠⸺</p>
				<p>My father could not help smiling for his soul⁠—his anger at the worst was never more than a spark;⁠—and the zeal and simplicity of <i>Trim</i>⁠—and the generous (though hobby-horsical) gallantry of my uncle <i>Toby</i>, brought him into perfect good humour with them in an instant.</p>
				<p>Generous souls!⁠—God prosper you both, and your mortar-pieces too! quoth my father to himself.</p>
