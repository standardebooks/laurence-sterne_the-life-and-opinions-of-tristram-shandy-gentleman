				<p>The corporal had slipped out about ten minutes before my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in order to fix his apparatus, and just give the enemy a shot or two before my uncle <i>Toby</i> came.</p>
				<p>He had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up together in front of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> sentry-box, leaving only an interval of about a yard and a half betwixt the three, on the right and left, for the convenience of charging, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—and the sake possibly of two batteries, which he might think double the honour of one.</p>
				<p>In the rear and facing this opening, with his back to the door of the sentry-box, for fear of being flanked, had the corporal wisely taken his post:⁠——He held the ivory pipe, appertaining to the battery on the right, betwixt the finger and thumb of his right hand,⁠—and the ebony pipe tipp’d with silver, which appertained to the battery on the left, betwixt the finger and thumb of the other⁠——and with his right knee fixed firm upon the ground, as if in the front rank of his platoon, was the corporal with his Montero-cap upon his head, furiously playing off his two cross batteries at the same time against the counter-guard, which faced the counter-scarp, where the attack was to be made that morning. His first intention, as I said, was no more than giving the enemy a single puff or two;⁠—but the pleasure of the <em>puffs</em>, as well as the <em>puffing</em>, had insensibly got hold of the corporal, and drawn him on from puff to puff, into the very height of the attack, by the time my uncle <i>Toby</i> joined him.</p>
				<p>’Twas well for my father, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> had not his will to make that day.</p>
