				<p>The city of <i>Limerick</i>, the siege of which was begun under his majesty king <i>William</i> himself, the year after I went into the army⁠—lies, an’ please your honours, in the middle of a devilish wet, swampy country.⁠—’Tis quite surrounded, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, with the <i>Shannon</i>, and is, by its situation, one of the strongest fortified places in <i>Ireland</i>.⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>I think this is a new fashion, quoth <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>, of beginning a medical lecture.⁠—’Tis all true, answered <i>Trim</i>.⁠—Then I wish the faculty would follow the cut of it, said <i>Yorick</i>.⁠—’Tis all cut through, an’ please your reverence, said the corporal, with drains and bogs; and besides, there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege, the whole country was like a puddle,⁠—’twas that, and nothing else, which brought on the flux, and which had like to have killed both his honour and myself; now there was no such thing, after the first ten days, continued the corporal, for a soldier to lie dry in his tent, without cutting a ditch round it, to draw off the water;⁠—nor was that enough, for those who could afford it, as his honour could, without setting fire every night to a pewter dish full of brandy, which took off the damp of the air, and made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove.⁠⸻</p>
				<p>And what conclusion dost thou draw, corporal <i>Trim</i>, cried my father, from all these premises?</p>
				<p>I infer, an’ please your worship, replied <i>Trim</i>, that the radical moisture is nothing in the world but ditch-water⁠—and that the radical heat, of those who can go to the expense of it, is burnt brandy,⁠—the radical heat and moisture of a private man, an’ please your honour, is nothing but ditch-water⁠—and a dram of geneva⁠⸺⁠and give us but enough of it, with a pipe of tobacco, to give us spirits, and drive away the vapours⁠—we know not what it is to fear death.</p>
				<p>I am at a loss, Captain <i>Shandy</i>, quoth <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>, to determine in which branch of learning your servant shines most, whether in physiology or divinity.⁠—<i>Slop</i> had not forgot <i>Trim’s</i> comment upon the sermon.⁠—</p>
				<p>It is but an hour ago, replied <i>Yorick</i>, since the corporal was examined in the latter, and pass’d muster with great honour.⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>The radical heat and moisture, quoth <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>, turning to my father, you must know, is the basis and foundation of our being⁠—as the root of a tree is the source and principle of its vegetation.⁠—It is inherent in the seeds of all animals, and may be preserved sundry ways, but principally in my opinion by <em>consubstantials</em>, <em>impriments</em>, and <em>occludents</em>.⁠⸺⁠Now this poor fellow, continued <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i>, pointing to the corporal, has had the misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric discourse upon this nice point.⁠⸺⁠That he has,⁠—said my father.⁠⸺⁠Very likely, said my uncle.⁠—I’m sure of it⁠—quoth <i>Yorick</i>.⁠⸺⁠</p>
