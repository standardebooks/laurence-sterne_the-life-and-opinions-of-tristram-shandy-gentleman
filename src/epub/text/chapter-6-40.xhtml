				<p>I am now beginning to get fairly into my work; and by the help of a vegetable diet, with a few of the cold seeds, I make no doubt but I shall be able to go on with my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> story, and my own, in a tolerable strait line. Now,</p>

				</figure>
				<p>These were the four lines I moved in through my first, second, third, and fourth volumes.⁠—In the fifth volume I have been very good,⁠⸺⁠the precise line I have described in it being this:</p>
				<figure id="illustration-4">
					<img alt="A squiggly line marked A, B, CC CCC, D." src="../images/illustration-4.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>By which it appears, that except at the curve, marked A, where I took a trip to <i>Navarre</i>,⁠—and the indented curve <i>B</i>, which is the short airing when I was there with the Lady <i>Baussiere</i> and her page,⁠—I have not taken the least frisk of a digression, till <i>John de la Casse’s</i> devils led me the round you see marked D.⁠—for as for <i>c c c c c</i> they are nothing but parentheses, and the common <em>ins</em> and <em>outs</em> incident to the lives of the greatest ministers of state; and when compared with what men have done,⁠—or with my own transgressions at the letters A B D⁠—they vanish into nothing.</p>
				<p>In this last volume I have done better still⁠—for from the end of <i>Le Fever’s</i> episode, to the beginning of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> campaigns,⁠—I have scarce stepped a yard out of my way.</p>
				<p>If I mend at this rate, it is not impossible⁠⸺⁠by the good leave of his grace of <i>Benevento’s</i> devils⁠⸺⁠but I may arrive hereafter at the excellency of going on even thus:</p>
				<figure id="illustration-5">
					<img alt="A straight line." src="../images/illustration-5.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw it, by a writing-master’s ruler (borrowed for that purpose), turning neither to the right hand or to the left.</p>
				<p>This <em>right line</em>,⁠—the pathway for Christians to walk in! say divines⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠The emblem of moral rectitude! says <i>Cicero</i>⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠The <em>best line!</em> say cabbage planters⁠⸺⁠is the shortest line, says <i>Archimedes</i>, which can be drawn from one given point to another.⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>I wish your ladyships would lay this matter to heart, in your next birthday suits!</p>
				<p>⸺⁠What a journey!</p>
				<p>Pray can you tell me,⁠—that is, without anger, before I write my chapter upon straight lines⁠⸺⁠by what mistake⁠⸺⁠who told them so⁠⸺⁠or how it has come to pass, that your men of wit and genius have all along confounded this line, with the line of <strong>gravitation</strong>?</p>
