				<p>The first thirty pages, said my father, turning over the leaves,⁠—are a little dry; and as they are not closely connected with the subject,⁠⸺for the present we’ll pass them by: ’tis a prefatory introduction, continued my father, or an introductory preface (for I am not determined which name to give it) upon political or civil government; the foundation of which being laid in the first conjunction betwixt male and female, for procreation of the species⁠⸺I was insensibly led into it.⁠⸺’Twas natural, said <i>Yorick</i>.</p>
				<p>The original of society, continued my father, I’m satisfied is, what <i>Politian</i> tells us, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, merely conjugal; and nothing more than the getting together of one man and one woman;⁠—to which, (according to <i>Hesiod</i>) the philosopher adds a servant:⁠⸺but supposing in the first beginning there were no men servants born⁠⸺he lays the foundation of it, in a man,⁠—a woman⁠—and a bull.⁠⸺I believe ’tis an ox, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, quoting the passage (<span xml:lang="el">οἶκον μὲν πρώτιστα, γυναῖκα τε, βοῦν τ’ ἀροτῆρα</span>).⁠⸺A bull must have given more trouble than his head was worth.⁠⸺But there is a better reason still, said my father (dipping his pen into his ink); for the ox being the most patient of animals, and the most useful withal in tilling the ground for their nourishment,⁠—was the properest instrument, and emblem too, for the new joined couple, that the creation could have associated with them.⁠—And there is a stronger reason, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, than them all for the ox.⁠—My father had not power to take his pen out of his ink-horn, till he had heard my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> reason.⁠—For when the ground was tilled, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and made worth inclosing, then they began to secure it by walls and ditches, which was the origin of fortification.⁠⸺True, true, dear <i>Toby</i>, cried my father, striking out the bull, and putting the ox in his place.</p>
				<p>My father gave <i>Trim</i> a nod, to snuff the candle, and resumed his discourse.</p>
				<p>⸺I enter upon this speculation, said my father carelessly, and half shutting the book, as he went on, merely to show the foundation of the natural relation between a father and his child; the right and jurisdiction over whom he acquires these several ways⁠—</p>
				<p>1st, by marriage.</p>
				<p>2nd, by adoption.</p>
				<p>3rd, by legitimation.</p>
				<p>And 4th, by procreation; all which I consider in their order.</p>
				<p>I lay a slight stress upon one of them, replied <i>Yorick</i>⁠⸺the act, especially where it ends there, in my opinion lays as little obligation upon the child, as it conveys power to the father.⁠—You are wrong,⁠—said my father argutely, and for this plain reason<span><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span></span> <span><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span></span> <span><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>—I own,</span></span> added my father, that the offspring, upon this account, is not so under the power and jurisdiction of the mother.⁠—But the reason, replied <i>Yorick</i>, equally holds good for her.⁠⸺She is under authority herself, said my father:⁠—and besides, continued my father, nodding his head, and laying his finger upon the side of his nose, as he assigned his reason,⁠—<em>she is not the principal agent</em>, Yorick.⁠—In what, quoth my uncle <i>Toby?</i> stopping his pipe.⁠—Though by all means, added my father (not attending to my uncle <i>Toby</i>) “<em>The son ought to pay her respect</em>,” as you may read, <i>Yorick</i>, at large in the first book of the Institutes of <i>Justinian</i>, at the eleventh title and the tenth section,⁠—I can read it as well, replied <i>Yorick</i>, in the Catechism.</p>
