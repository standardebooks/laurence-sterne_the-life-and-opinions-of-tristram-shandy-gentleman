			<p>⸻“So hating, I say, to make mysteries of <em>nothing</em>”⁠⸺⁠I entrusted it with the post-boy, as soon as ever I got off the stones; he gave a crack with his whip to balance the compliment; and with the thill-horse trotting, and a sort of an up and a down of the other, we danced it along to <i xml:lang="fr">Ailly au clochers</i>, famed in days of yore for the finest chimes in the world; but we danced through it without music⁠—the chimes being greatly out of order⁠—(as in truth they were through all <i>France</i>).</p>
			<p>And so making all possible speed, from</p>
			<p><i xml:lang="fr">Ailly au clochers</i>, I got to <i>Hixcourt</i>,<br/>
			from <i>Hixcourt</i>, I got to <i>Pequignay</i>, and<br/>
			from <i>Pequignay</i>, I got to <b>Amiens</b>,<br/>
			concerning which town I have nothing to inform you, but what I have informed you once before⁠⸺⁠and that was⁠—that <i>Janatone</i> went there to school.</p>
