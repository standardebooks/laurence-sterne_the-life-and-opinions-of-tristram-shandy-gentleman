				<p>O blessed health! cried my father, making an exclamation, as he turned over the leaves to the next chapter, thou art above all gold and treasure; ’tis thou who enlargest the soul,⁠—and openest all its powers to receive instruction and to relish virtue.⁠—He that has thee, has little more to wish for;⁠—and he that is so wretched as to want thee,⁠—wants everything with thee.</p>
				<p>I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important head, said my father, into a very little room, therefore we’ll read the chapter quite through.</p>
				<p>My father read as follows:</p>
				<p>“The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture”⁠—You have proved that matter of fact, I suppose, above, said <i>Yorick</i>. Sufficiently, replied my father.</p>
				<p>In saying this, my father shut the book,⁠—not as if he resolved to read no more of it, for he kept his forefinger in the chapter:⁠——nor pettishly,⁠—for he shut the book slowly; his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon the upper-side of the cover, as his three fingers supported the lower side of it, without the least compressive violence.⁠——</p>
				<p>I have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father, nodding to <i>Yorick</i>, most sufficiently in the preceding chapter.</p>
				<p>Now could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth had wrote a chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the <i>radical heat</i> and the <i>radical moisture</i>,⁠—and that he had managed the point so well, that there was not one single word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture, throughout the whole chapter,⁠—or a single syllable in it, <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i>, directly or indirectly, upon the contention betwixt these two powers in any part of the animal œconomy⁠——</p>
				<p>“O thou eternal Maker of all beings!”⁠—he would cry, striking his breast with his right hand (in case he had one)⁠—“Thou whose power and goodness can enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to this infinite degree of excellence and perfection,⁠—What have we <b>Moonites</b> done?”</p>
