				<p>Why weavers, gardeners, and gladiators⁠—or a man with a pined leg (proceeding from some ailment in the <em>foot</em>)⁠—should ever have had some tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for them, are points well and duly settled and accounted for by ancient and modern physiologists.</p>
				<p>A water-drinker, provided he is a profess’d one, and does it without fraud or covin, is precisely in the same predicament: not that, at first sight, there is any consequence, or show of logic in it, “That a rill of cold water dribbling through my inward parts, should light up a torch in my <i>Jenny’s</i>⁠—”</p>
				<p>⸺⁠The proposition does not strike one; on the contrary, it seems to run opposite to the natural workings of causes and effects⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>But it shows the weakness and imbecility of human reason.</p>
				<p>⸺“And in perfect good health with it?”</p>
				<p>—The most perfect,⁠—Madam, that friendship herself could wish me⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>“And drink nothing!⁠—nothing but water?”</p>
				<p>—Impetuous fluid! the moment thou pressest against the floodgates of the brain⁠⸺⁠see how they give way!⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>In swims <b>Curiosity</b>, beckoning to her damsels to follow⁠—they dive into the centre of the current⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p><b>Fancy</b> sits musing upon the bank, and with her eyes following the stream, turns straws and bulrushes into masts and bowsprits⁠⸺⁠And <b>Desire</b>, with vest held up to the knee in one hand, snatches at them, as they swim by her with the other⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>O ye water-drinkers! is it then by this delusive fountain, that ye have so often governed and turn’d this world about like a mill-wheel⁠—grinding the faces of the impotent⁠—bepowdering their ribs⁠—bepeppering their noses, and changing sometimes even the very frame and face of nature⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>If I was you, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, I would drink more water, <i>Eugenius</i>⁠—And, if I was you, <i>Yorick</i>, replied <i>Eugenius</i>, so would I.</p>
				<p>Which shows they had both read <i>Longinus</i>⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>For my own part, I am resolved never to read any book but my own, as long as I live.</p>
