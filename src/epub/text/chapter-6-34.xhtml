<p><span class="firstword">I told</span> the Christian reader in the
beginning of the chapter which preceded my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
apologetical oration,—though in a different trope from what I
should make use of now, That the peace of <i>Utrecht</i> was within an
ace of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle <i>Toby</i> and his
hobby-horse, as it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the
confederating powers.</p>
<p>There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his
horse, which as good as says to him, “I’ll go afoot, Sir, all the days
of my life, before I would ride a single mile upon your back again.” Now
my uncle <i>Toby</i> could not be said to dismount his horse in this
manner; for in strictness of language, he could not be said to dismount
his horse at all——his horse rather flung
him——and somewhat <i>viciously</i>, which made my uncle
<i>Toby</i> take it ten times more unkindly. Let this matter be settled
by state-jockies as they like.——It created, I say,
a sort of shyness betwixt my uncle <i>Toby</i> and his
hobby-horse.——He had no occasion for him from the month of
<i>March</i>
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page341" name="page341">341</a></span>
to <i>November</i>, which was the summer after the articles were signed,
except it was now and then to take a short ride out, just to see that
the fortifications and harbour of <i>Dunkirk</i> were demolished,
according to stipulation.</p>
<p>The <i>French</i> were so backwards all that summer in setting about
that affair, and Monsieur <i>Tugghe</i>, the Deputy from the magistrates
of <i>Dunkirk</i>, presented so many affecting petitions to the
queen,—beseeching her majesty to cause only her thunder-bolts to
fall upon the martial works, which might have incurred her
displeasure,—but to spare—to spare the mole, for the mole’s
sake; which, in its naked situation, could be no more than an object of
pity——and the queen (who was but a woman) being of a pitiful
disposition,—and her ministers also, they not wishing in their
hearts to have the town dismantled, for these private reasons,<span id="privatereasons"></span>

; so that the whole went heavily on with my uncle <i>Toby</i>; insomuch,
that it was not within three full months, after he and the corporal had
constructed the town, and put it in a condition to be destroyed, that
the several commandants, commissaries, deputies, negociators, and
intendants, would permit him to set about it.——Fatal
interval of inactivity!<!-- </p> -->
<p>The corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a breach in
the ramparts, or main fortifications of the
town——No,—that will never do, corporal, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, for in going that way to work with the town, the
<i>English</i> garrison will not be safe in it an hour; because if the
<ins class="correction" title="printed in Roman (non-italic) type"><i>French</i></ins> are treacherous——They are as
treacherous as devils, an’ please your honour, said the
corporal——It gives me concern always when I hear it,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>,—for they don’t want
personal bravery; and if a breach is made in the ramparts, they may
enter it, and make themselves masters of the place when they
please:——Let them enter it, said the corporal, lifting up
his pioneer’s spade in both his hands, as if he was going to lay about
him with it,—let them enter, an’ please your honour, if they
dare.——In cases like this, corporal, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, slipping his right hand down to the middle of his cane, and
holding it afterwards truncheon-wise with his forefinger
extended,——’tis no part of the consideration of a
commandant, what the enemy dare,—or what they dare not do; he must
act with prudence. We will begin with the outworks both towards the
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page342" name="page342">342</a></span>
sea and the land, and particularly with fort <i>Louis</i>, the most
distant of them all, and demolish it first,—and the rest, one by
one, both on our right and left, as we retreat towards the
town;——then we’ll demolish the mole,—next fill up the
harbour,—then retire into the citadel, and blow it up into the
air: and having done that, corporal, we’ll embark for
<i>England</i>.——We are there, quoth the corporal,
recollecting himself——Very true, said my uncle
<i>Toby</i>—looking at the church.</p>
