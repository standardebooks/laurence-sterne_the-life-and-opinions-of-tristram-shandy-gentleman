				<p>There was not any one scene more entertaining in our family—and to do it justice in this point;——and I here put off my cap and lay it upon the table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration to the world concerning this one article the more solemn——that I believe in my soul (unless my love and partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the supreme Maker and first Designer of all things never made or put a family together (in that period at least of it which I have sat down to write the story of)——where the characters of it were cast or contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was, for this end; or in which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes, and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to night, were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the <b>Shandy Family</b>.</p>
				<p>Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this whimsical theatre of ours——than what frequently arose out of this self-same chapter of long noses———especially when my father’s imagination was heated with the enquiry, and nothing would serve him but to heat my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> too.</p>
				<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> would give my father all possible fair play in this attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoaking his pipe for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon his head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus’s</i> solutions into it.</p>
				<p>Whether they were above my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> reason———or contrary to it———or that his brain was like <i>damp</i> timber, and no spark could possibly take hold——or that it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins, and such military disqualifications to his seeing clearly into <i>Prignitz</i> and <i>Scroderus’s</i> doctrines——I say not—let schoolmen—scullions, anatomists, and engineers, fight for it among themselves——</p>
				<p>’Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair, that my father had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and render out of <i>Slawkenbergius’s Latin</i>, of which, as he was no great master, his translation was not always of the purest——and generally least so where ’twas most wanted.—This naturally open’d a door to a second misfortune;——that in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> eyes———my father’s ideas ran on as much faster than the translation, as the translation outmoved my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>———neither the one or the other added much to the perspicuity of my father’s lecture.</p>
