				<p>As I never had any intention of beginning the Digression I am making all this preparation for, till I come to the 15th chapter⁠——I have this chapter to put to whatever use I think proper⁠——I have twenty this moment ready for it⁠——I could write my chapter of Button-holes in it⁠——</p>
				<p>Or my chapter of <i>Pishes</i>, which should follow them⁠——</p>
				<p>Or my chapter of <i>Knots</i>, in case their reverences have done with them⁠——they might lead me into mischief: the safest way is to follow the track of the learned, and raise objections against what I have been writing, tho’ I declare beforehand, I know no more than my heels how to answer them.</p>
				<p>And first, it may be said, there is a pelting kind of <em>thersitical</em> satire, as black as the very ink ’tis wrote with⁠——(and by the bye, whoever says so, is indebted to the muster-master general of the <i>Grecian</i> army, for suffering the name of so ugly and foul-mouth’d a man as <i>Thersites</i> to continue upon his roll⁠——for it has furnish’d him with an epithet)⁠——in these productions he will urge, all the personal washings and scrubbings upon earth do a sinking genius no sort of good⁠——but just the contrary, inasmuch as the dirtier the fellow is, the better generally he succeeds in it.</p>
				<p>To this, I have no other answer⁠——at least ready⁠——but that the Archbishop of <i>Benevento</i> wrote his <em>nasty</em> Romance of the <i>Galatea</i>, as all the world knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and purple pair of breeches; and that the penance set him of writing a commentary upon the book of the <i>Revelations</i>, as severe as it was look’d upon by one part of the world, was far from being deem’d so by the other, upon the single account of that <i>Investment</i>.</p>
				<p>Another objection, to all this remedy, is its want of universality; forasmuch as the shaving part of it, upon which so much stress is laid, by an unalterable law of nature excludes one half of the species entirely from its use: all I can say is, that female writers, whether of <i>England</i>, or of <i>France</i>, must e’en go without it⁠———</p>
				<p>As for the <i>Spanish</i> ladies⁠——I am in no sort of distress⁠——</p>
