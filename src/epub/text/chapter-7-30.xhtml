				<p>To those who call vexations, <strong>vexations</strong>, as knowing what they are, there could not be a greater, than to be the best part of a day at <i>Lyons</i>, the most opulent and flourishing city in <i>France</i>, enriched with the most fragments of antiquity⁠—and not be able to see it. To be withheld upon <em>any</em> account, must be a vexation; but to be withheld <em>by</em> a vexation⁠⸺must certainly be, what philosophy justly calls</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><b>Vexation</b><br/>
						upon<br/>
						<b>Vexation</b>.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I had got my two dishes of milk coffee (which by the bye is excellently good for a consumption, but you must boil the milk and coffee together⁠—otherwise ’tis only coffee and milk)⁠—and as it was no more than eight in the morning, and the boat did not go off till noon, I had time to see enough of <i>Lyons</i> to tire the patience of all the friends I had in the world with it. I will take a walk to the cathedral, said I, looking at my list, and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of <i>Lippius</i> of <i>Basil</i>, in the first place⁠⸺</p>
				<p>Now, of all things in the world, I understand the least of mechanism⁠⸺I have neither genius, or taste, or fancy⁠—and have a brain so entirely unapt for everything of that kind, that I solemnly declare I was never yet able to comprehend the principles of motion of a squirrel cage, or a common knife-grinder’s wheel⁠—tho’ I have many an hour of my life look’d up with great devotion at the one⁠—and stood by with as much patience as any christian ever could do, at the other⁠⸺</p>
				<p>I’ll go see the surprising movements of this great clock, said I, the very first thing I do: and then I will pay a visit to the great library of the Jesuits, and procure, if possible, a sight of the thirty volumes of the general history of <i>China</i>, wrote (not in the <i>Tartarean</i>, but) in the <i>Chinese</i> language, and in the <i>Chinese</i> character too.</p>
				<p>Now I almost know as little of the <i>Chinese</i> language, as I do of the mechanism of <i>Lippius’s</i> clockwork; so, why these should have jostled themselves into the two first articles of my list⁠⸺I leave to the curious as a problem of Nature. I own it looks like one of her ladyship’s obliquities; and they who court her, are interested in finding out her humour as much as I.</p>
				<p>When these curiosities are seen, quoth I, half addressing myself to my <i>valet de place</i>, who stood behind me⁠⸺’twill be no hurt if we go to the church of <abbr>St.</abbr> <i>Irenæus</i>, and see the pillar to which <i>Christ</i> was tied⁠⸺and after that, the house where <i>Pontius Pilate</i> lived⁠⸺’Twas at the next town, said the <i xml:lang="fr">valet de place</i>⁠—at <i>Vienne</i>; I am glad of it, said I, rising briskly from my chair, and walking across the room with strides twice as long as my usual pace⁠⸺“for so much the sooner shall I be at the <i>Tomb of the two lovers</i>.”</p>
				<p>What was the cause of this movement, and why I took such long strides in uttering this⁠⸺I might leave to the curious too; but as no principle of clockwork is concerned in it⁠⸺’twill be as well for the reader if I explain it myself.</p>
