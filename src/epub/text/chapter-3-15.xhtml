				<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> was within an ace of being an exception to all this argumentation: for happening to have his green bays bag upon his knees, when he began to parody my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠—’twas as good as the best mantle in the world to him: for which purpose, when he foresaw the sentence would end in his new-invented <em>forceps</em>, he thrust his hand into the bag in order to have them ready to clap in, when your reverences took so much notice of the ***, which had he managed⁠⸺⁠my uncle <i>Toby</i> had certainly been overthrown: the sentence and the argument in that case jumping closely in one point, so like the two lines which form the salient angle of a ravelin,⁠⸺⁠<abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> would never have given them up;⁠—and my uncle <i>Toby</i> would as soon have thought of flying, as taking them by force: but <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <i>Slop</i> fumbled so vilely in pulling them out, it took off the whole effect, and what was a ten times worse evil (for they seldom come alone in this life) in pulling out his <em>forceps</em>, his <em>forceps</em> unfortunately drew out the <em>squirt</em> along with it.</p>
				<p>When a proposition can be taken in two senses⁠—’tis a law in disputation, That the respondent may reply to which of the two he pleases, or finds most convenient for him.⁠⸺⁠This threw the advantage of the argument quite on my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> side.⁠⸺“Good God!” cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, “<em>are children brought into the world with a squirt?</em>”</p>
