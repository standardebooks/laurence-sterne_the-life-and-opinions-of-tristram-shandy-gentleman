				<p><span class="firstword">And</span> now for <i>Lippius’s</i> clock! said I, with the air of a man, who had got thro’ all his difficulties——nothing can prevent us seeing that, and the <i>Chinese</i> history, &amp;c., except the time, said <i>François</i>——for ’tis almost eleven—Then we must speed the faster, said I, striding it away to the cathedral.</p>
				<p>I cannot say, in my heart, that it gave me any concern in being told by one of the minor canons, as I was entering the west door,—That <i>Lippius’s</i> great clock was all out of joints, and had not gone for some years——It will give me the more time, thought I, to peruse the <i>Chinese</i> history; and besides I shall be able to give the world a better account of the clock in its decay, than I could have done in its flourishing <span class="locked">condition——</span></p>
				<p>——And so away I posted to the college of the Jesuits.</p>
				<p>Now it is with the project of getting a peep at the history of <i>China</i> in <i>Chinese</i> characters—as with many others I could mention, which strike the fancy only at a distance; for as I came nearer and nearer to the point—my blood cool’d—the freak gradually went off, till at length I would not have given a cherrystone to have it gratified———The truth was, my time was short, and my heart was at the Tomb of the Lovers——I wish to God, said I, as I got the rapper in my hand, that the key of the library may be but lost; it fell out as <span class="locked">well———</span></p>
				<p><i>For all the <span class="smallcaps">Jesuits</span> had got the cholic</i>—and to that degree, as never was known in the memory of the oldest practitioner.</p>
