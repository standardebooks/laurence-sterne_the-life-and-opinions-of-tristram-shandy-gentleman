<p><span class="firstword">What</span> a rate have I gone on at,

together, without looking once behind, or even on one side of me, to see
whom I trod upon!—I’ll tread upon no one——quoth I to
myself when I mounted———I’ll take a good rattling
gallop; but I’ll not hurt the poorest jackass upon the
road.——So off I set——up one
lane———down another, through this
turnpike——over that, as if the arch-jockey of jockeys had
got behind me.</p>
<p>Now ride at this rate with what good intention and resolution you
<ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘way’">may</ins>——’tis a million to one you’ll do some one a
mischief, if not yourself———He’s flung—he’s
off—he’s lost his hat—he’s down———he’ll
break his neck——see!——if he has not galloped
full among the scaffolding of the undertaking
criticks!——he’ll knock his brains out against some of their
posts—he’s bounced out!—look—he’s now riding like a
mad-cap full tilt through a whole crowd of painters, fiddlers, poets,
biographers, physicians, lawyers, logicians, players, schoolmen,
churchmen,

statesmen, soldiers, casuists, connoisseurs, prelates, popes, and
engineers.—Don’t fear, said I—I’ll not hurt the poorest
jack-ass upon the king’s highway.—But your horse throws dirt; see
you’ve splash’d a bishop.——I hope in God, ’twas only
<i>Ernulphus</i>, said I.———But you have squirted full
in the faces of Mess. <i>Le Moyne</i>, <i>De Romigny</i>, and <i>De
Marcilly</i>, doctors of the <i>Sorbonne</i>.———That
was last year, replied I.—But you have trod this moment upon a
king.——Kings have bad times on’t, said I, to be trod upon by
such people as me.</p>
<p>You have done it, replied my accuser.</p>
<p>I deny it, quoth I, and so have got off, and here am I standing with
my bridle in one hand, and with my cap in the other, to tell my
story.———And what is it? You shall hear in the next
chapter.</p>
