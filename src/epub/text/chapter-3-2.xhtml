<p>“—<span class="firstword">What</span> prodigious armies you
had in <i>Flanders!</i>”——</p>
<p>Brother <i>Toby</i>, replied my father, taking his wig from off his
head with his right hand, and with his <i>left</i> pulling out a striped
<i>India</i> handkerchief from his right coat pocket, in order to rub
his head, as he argued the point with my uncle <span class="locked"><i>Toby</i>.——</span></p>
<p>——Now, in this I think my father was much to blame; and I
will give you my reasons for it.</p>
<p>Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than,
“<i>Whether my father should have taken off his wig with his right hand
or with his left</i>,”——have divided the greatest kingdoms,
and made the crowns of the monarchs who governed them, to totter upon
their heads.——But need I tell you, Sir, that the
circumstances with which every thing in this world is begirt, give every
thing in this world its size and shape!—and by tightening it, or
relaxing it, this way or that, make the thing to be, what it
is—great—little—good—bad—indifferent or
not indifferent, just as the case happens?</p>
<p>As my father’s <i>India</i> handkerchief was in his right coat
pocket, he should by no means have suffered his right hand to have got
engaged: on the contrary, instead of taking off his wig with it, as he
did, he ought to have committed that entirely to the left; and then,
when the natural exigency my father was under of rubbing his head,
called out for his handkerchief, he would have had nothing in the world
to have done, but to have put his right hand into his right coat pocket
and taken it out;——which he might have done without any
violence, or the least ungraceful twist in any one tendon or muscle of
his whole body</p>
<p>In this case, (unless, indeed, my father had been resolved to make a
fool of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left
hand——or by making some nonsensical angle or other at his
elbow-joint, or arm-pit)—his whole attitude had been
easy—natural—unforced:
<i>Reynolds</i> himself, as great and gracefully as he paints, might
have painted him as he sat.</p>
<p>Now as my father managed this matter,—consider what a devil of
a figure my father made of himself.</p>
<p>In the latter end of Queen <i>Anne’s</i> reign, and in the beginning
of the reign of King <i>George</i> the first—“<i>Coat pockets were
cut very low down in the skirt</i>.”—I need say no
more—the father of mischief, had he been hammering at it a month,
could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my father’s
situation.</p>
