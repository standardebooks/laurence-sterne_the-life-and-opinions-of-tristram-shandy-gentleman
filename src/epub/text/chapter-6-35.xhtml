				<p>A delusive, delicious consultation or two of this kind, betwixt my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i>, upon the demolition of <i>Dunkirk</i>,⁠—for a moment rallied back the ideas of those pleasures, which were slipping from under him:⁠⸺⁠still⁠—still all went on heavily⁠⸺⁠the magic left the mind the weaker⁠—<b>Stillness</b>, with <b>Silence</b> at her back, entered the solitary parlour, and drew their gauzy mantle over my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> head;⁠⸺⁠and <b>Listlessness</b>, with her lax fibre and undirected eye, sat quietly down beside him in his armchair.⁠⸺⁠No longer <i>Amberg</i> and <i>Rhinberg</i>, and <i>Limbourg</i>, and <i>Huy</i>, and <i>Bonn</i>, in one year,⁠—and the prospect of <i>Landen</i>, and <i>Trerebach</i>, and <i>Drusen</i>, and <i>Dendermond</i>, the next,⁠—hurried on the blood:⁠—No longer did saps, and mines, and blinds, and gabions, and palisadoes, keep out this fair enemy of man’s repose:⁠⸺⁠No more could my uncle <i>Toby</i>, after passing the <i>French</i> lines, as he eat his egg at supper, from thence break into the heart of <i>France</i>,⁠—cross over the <i>Oyes</i>, and with all <i>Picardie</i> open behind him, march up to the gates of <i>Paris</i>, and fall asleep with nothing but ideas of glory:⁠⸺⁠No more was he to dream he had fixed the royal standard upon the tower of the <i>Bastile</i>, and awake with it streaming in his head.</p>
				<p>⸺⁠Softer visions,⁠—gentler vibrations stole sweetly in upon his slumbers;⁠—the trumpet of war fell out of his hands,⁠—he took up the lute, sweet instrument! of all others the most delicate! the most difficult!⁠⸺⁠how wilt thou touch it, my dear uncle <i>Toby?</i></p>
