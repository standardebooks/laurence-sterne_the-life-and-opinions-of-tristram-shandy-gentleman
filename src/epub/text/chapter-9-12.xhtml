				<p>Upon looking back from the end of the last chapter, and surveying the texture of what has been wrote, it is necessary, that upon this page and the three following, a good quantity of heterogeneous matter be inserted to keep up that just balance betwixt wisdom and folly, without which a book would not hold together a single year: nor is it a poor creeping digression (which but for the name of, a man might continue as well going on in the king’s highway) which will do the business⁠⸺⁠no; if it is to be a digression, it must be a good frisky one, and upon a frisky subject too, where neither the horse or his rider are to be caught, but by rebound.</p>
				<p>The only difficulty, is raising powers suitable to the nature of the service: <b>Fancy</b> is capricious⁠—<b>Wit</b> must not be searched for⁠—and <b>Pleasantry</b> (good-natured slut as she is) will not come in at a call, was an empire to be laid at her feet.</p>
				<p>⸺⁠The best way for a man is to say his prayers⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>Only if it puts him in mind of his infirmities and defects as well ghostly as bodily⁠—for that purpose, he will find himself rather worse after he has said them than before⁠—for other purposes, better.</p>
				<p>For my own part, there is not a way either moral or mechanical under heaven that I could think of, which I have not taken with myself in this case: sometimes by addressing myself directly to the soul herself, and arguing the point over and over again with her upon the extent of her own faculties⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠I never could make them an inch the wider⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>Then by changing my system, and trying what could be made of it upon the body, by temperance, soberness, and chastity: These are good, quoth I, in themselves⁠—they are good, absolutely;⁠—they are good, relatively;⁠—they are good for health⁠—they are good for happiness in this world⁠—they are good for happiness in the next⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>In short, they were good for everything but the thing wanted; and there they were good for nothing, but to leave the soul just as heaven made it: as for the theological virtues of faith and hope, they give it courage; but then that snivelling virtue of Meekness (as my father would always call it) takes it quite away again, so you are exactly where you started.</p>
				<p>Now in all common and ordinary cases, there is nothing which I have found to answer so well as this⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠Certainly, if there is any dependence upon Logic, and that I am not blinded by self-love, there must be something of true genius about me, merely upon this symptom of it, that I do not know what envy is: for never do I hit upon any invention or device which tendeth to the furtherance of good writing, but I instantly make it public; willing that all mankind should write as well as myself.</p>
				<p>⸺⁠Which they certainly will, when they think as little.</p>
