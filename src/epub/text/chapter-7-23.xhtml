				<p>We are ruin’d and undone, my child, said the abbess to <i>Margarita</i>,⁠⸺⁠we shall be here all night⁠⸺⁠we shall be plunder’d⁠⸺⁠we shall be ravish’d⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠We shall be ravish’d, said <i>Margarita</i>, as sure as a gun.</p>
				<p><i xml:lang="la">Sancta Maria!</i> cried the abbess (forgetting the <em>O!</em>)⁠—why was I govern’d by this wicked stiff joint? why did I leave the convent of <i>Andoüillets?</i> and why didst thou not suffer thy servant to go unpolluted to her tomb?</p>
				<p>O my finger! my finger! cried the novice, catching fire at the word <em>servant</em>⁠—why was I not content to put it here, or there, any where rather than be in this strait?</p>
				<p>Strait! said the abbess.</p>
				<p>Strait⁠⸺⁠said the novice; for terror had struck their understandings⁠⸺⁠the one knew not what she said⁠⸺⁠the other what she answer’d.</p>
				<p>O my virginity! virginity! cried the abbess.</p>
				<p>⸺⁠inity!⁠⸺⁠inity! said the novice, sobbing.</p>
