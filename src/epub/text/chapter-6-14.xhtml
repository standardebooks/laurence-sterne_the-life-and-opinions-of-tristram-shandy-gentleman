				<p>What a jovial and a merry world would this be, may it please your worships, but for that inextricable labyrinth of debts, cares, woes, want, grief, discontent, melancholy, large jointures, impositions, and lies!</p>
				<p>Doctor <i>Slop</i>, like a son of a w——, as my father called him for it,—to exalt himself,—debased me to death,—and made ten thousand times more of <i>Susannah’s</i> accident, than there was any grounds for; so that in a week’s time, or less, it was in everybody’s mouth, <i>That poor Master Shandy</i> <span id="mastershandy"/><script type="text/javascript"> asterisks("mastershandy",1,1); </script> <noscript><span class="space35">* * * * * * * * * *</span>* </noscript> entirely.—And <b>Fame</b>, who loves to double everything,—in three days more, had sworn, positively she saw it,—and all the world, as usual, gave credit to her evidence——“That the nursery window had not only<span id="notonly"/><script type="text/javascript"> asterisks("notonly",1.9,1); </script> <noscript><span class="space35">* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</span>* </noscript> ;——but that<span id="butthat"/><script type="text/javascript"> asterisks("butthat",1.9,0); </script> <noscript><span class="space35">* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</span>* </noscript> ’s also.”</p>
				<p>Could the world have been sued like a <strong>body-corporate</strong>,—my father had brought an action upon the case, and trounced it sufficiently; but to fall foul of individuals about it——as every soul who had mentioned the affair, did it with the greatest pity imaginable;——’twas like flying in the very face of his best friends:——And yet to acquiesce under the report, in silence—was to acknowledge it openly,—at least in the opinion of one half of the world; and to make a bustle again, in contradicting it,—was to confirm it as strongly in the opinion of the other half.———</p>
				<p>——Was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so hampered? said my father.</p>
				<p>I would shew him publickly, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, at the market cross.</p>
				<p>——’Twill have no effect, said my father.</p>
