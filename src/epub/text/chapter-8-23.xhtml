<p><span class="firstword">As</span> soon as the corporal had finished
the story of his amour—or rather my uncle <i>Toby</i> for
him—Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> silently sallied forth from her arbour,
replaced the pin in her mob, pass’d the wicker-gate, and advanced slowly
towards my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> sentry-box: the disposition which
<i>Trim</i> had made in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> mind, was too favourable
a crisis to be let <span class="locked">slipp’d——</span></p>
<p>——The attack was determin’d upon: it was facilitated
still more by my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> having ordered the corporal to
wheel off the pioneer’s shovel, the spade, the pick-axe, the picquets,
and other military stores which lay scatter’d upon the ground where
<i>Dunkirk</i> stood—the corporal had march’d—the field was
clear.</p>
<p>Now, consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or
writing, or anything else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a man
has occasion to do—to act by plan: for if ever Plan, independent
of all circumstances, deserved registering in letters of gold
(I mean in the archives of <i>Gotham</i>)—it was certainly
the <span class="smallcaps">Plan</span> of Mrs. <i>Wadman’s</i> attack
of my uncle <i>Toby</i> in his sentry-box, <span class="smallcaps">by
Plan</span>——Now the plan hanging up in it at this juncture,
being the Plan of <i>Dunkirk</i>—and the tale of <i>Dunkirk</i> a
tale of relaxation, it opposed every impression she could make: and
besides, could she have gone upon it—the manœuvre of fingers and
hands in the attack of the sentry-box, was so outdone by that of the
fair <i>Beguine’s</i>, in <i>Trim’s</i> story—that just then, that
particular attack, however successful before—became the most
heartless attack that could be <span class="locked">made——</span></p>
<p>O! let woman alone for this. Mrs. <i>Wadman</i> had scarce open’d the
wicket-gate, when her genius sported with the change of
circumstances.</p>
<p>——She formed a new attack in a moment.</p>
