				<p>The Fates, who certainly all foreknew of these amours of widow <i>Wadman</i> and my uncle <i>Toby</i>, had, from the first creation of matter and motion (and with more courtesy than they usually do things of this kind), established such a chain of causes and effects hanging so fast to one another, that it was scarce possible for my uncle <i>Toby</i> to have dwelt in any other house in the world, or to have occupied any other garden in <i>Christendom</i>, but the very house and garden which join’d and laid parallel to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman’s</i>; this, with the advantage of a thickset arbour in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman’s</i> garden, but planted in the hedgerow of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>, put all the occasions into her hands which Love-militancy wanted; she could observe my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> motions, and was mistress likewise of his councils of war; and as his unsuspecting heart had given leave to the corporal, through the mediation of <i>Bridget</i>, to make her a wicker-gate of communication to enlarge her walks, it enabled her to carry on her approaches to the very door of the sentry-box; and sometimes out of gratitude, to make an attack, and endeavour to blow my uncle <i>Toby</i> up in the very sentry-box itself.</p>
