				<p>The abbess of <i>Andoüillets</i>, which, if you look into the large set of provincial maps now publishing at <i>Paris</i>, you will find situated amongst the hills which divide <i>Burgundy</i> from <i>Savoy</i>, being in danger of an <i xml:lang="la">Anchylosis</i> or stiff joint (the <i xml:lang="la">sinovia</i> of her knee becoming hard by long matins), and having tried every remedy⁠——first, prayers and thanksgiving; then invocations to all the saints in heaven promiscuously⁠——then particularly to every saint who had ever had a stiff leg, before her⁠——then touching it with all the reliques of the convent, principally with the thigh-bone of the man of <i>Lystra</i>, who had been impotent from his youth⁠——then wrapping it up in her veil when she went to bed⁠—then cross-wise her rosary⁠—then bringing in to her aid the secular arm, and anointing it with oils and hot fat of animals⁠——then treating it with emollient and resolving fomentations⁠——then with poultices of marsh-mallows, mallows, bonus Henricus, white lillies and fenugreek⁠—then taking the woods, I mean the smoak of ’em, holding her scapulary across her lap⁠——then decoctions of wild chicory, water-cresses, chervil, sweet cecily and cochlearia⁠——and nothing all this while answering, was prevailed on at last to try the hot baths of <i>Bourbon</i>⁠——so having first obtain’d leave of the visitor-general to take care of her existence⁠—she ordered all to be got ready for her journey: a novice of the convent of about seventeen, who had been troubled with a whitloe in her middle finger, by sticking it constantly into the abbess’s cast poultices, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—had gained such an interest, that overlooking a sciatical old nun, who might have been set up for ever by the hot-baths of <i>Bourbon</i>, <i>Margarita</i>, the little novice, was elected as the companion of the journey.</p>
				<p>An old calesh, belonging to the abbesse, lined with green frize, was ordered to be drawn out into the sun⁠—the gardener of the convent being chosen muleteer⁠—led out the two old mules, to clip the hair from the rump-ends of their tails, whilst a couple of lay-sisters were busied, the one in darning the lining, and the other in sewing on the shreads of yellow binding, which the teeth of time had unravelled⁠——the under-gardener dress’d the muleteer’s hat in hot wine-lees⁠——and a taylor sat musically at it, in a shed over-against the convent, in assorting four dozen of bells for the harness, whistling to each bell, as he tied it on with a thong.⁠——</p>
				<p>——The carpenter and the smith of <i>Andoüillets</i> held a council of wheels; and by seven, the morning after, all look’d spruce, and was ready at the gate of the convent for the hot-baths of <i>Bourbon</i>⁠—two rows of the unfortunate stood ready there an hour before.</p>
				<p>The abbess of <i>Andoüillets</i>, supported by <i>Margarita</i> the novice, advanced slowly to the calesh, both clad in white, with their black rosaries hanging at their breasts⁠——</p>
				<p>——There was a simple solemnity in the contrast: they entered the calesh; and nuns in the same uniform, sweet emblem of innocence, each occupied a window, and as the abbess and <i>Margarita</i> look’d up⁠—each (the sciatical poor nun excepted)⁠—each stream’d out the end of her veil in the air⁠—then kiss’d the lilly hand which let it go: the good abbess and <i>Margarita</i> laid their hands saint-wise upon their breasts⁠—look’d up to heaven⁠—then to them⁠—and look’d “God bless you, dear sisters.”</p>
				<p>I declare I am interested in this story, and wish I had been there.</p>
				<p>The gardener, whom I shall now call the muleteer, was a little, hearty, broad-set, good-natured, chattering, toping kind of a fellow, who troubled his head very little with the <em>hows</em> and <em>whens</em> of life; so had mortgaged a month of his conventical wages in a borrachio, or leathern cask of wine, which he had disposed behind the calesh, with a large russet-coloured riding-coat over it, to guard it from the sun; and as the weather was hot, and he not a niggard of his labours, walking ten times more than he rode⁠—he found more occasions than those of nature, to fall back to the rear of his carriage; till by frequent coming and going, it had so happen’d, that all his wine had leak’d out at the <em>legal</em> vent of the borrachio, before one half of the journey was finish’d.</p>
				<p>Man is a creature born to habitudes. The day had been sultry⁠—the evening was delicious⁠—the wine was generous⁠—the <i>Burgundian</i> hill on which it grew was steep⁠—a little tempting bush over the door of a cool cottage at the foot of it, hung vibrating in full harmony with the passions⁠—a gentle air rustled distinctly through the leaves⁠—“Come⁠—come, thirsty muleteer⁠—come in.”</p>
				<p>—The muleteer was a son of <i>Adam</i>; I need not say a word more. He gave the mules, each of ’em, a sound lash, and looking in the abbess’s and <i>Margarita’s</i> faces (as he did it)⁠—as much as to say “here I am”⁠—he gave a second good crack⁠—as much as to say to his mules, “get on”⁠——so slinking behind, he enter’d the little inn at the foot of the hill.</p>
				<p>The muleteer, as I told you, was a little, joyous, chirping fellow, who thought not of to-morrow, nor of what had gone before, or what was to follow it, provided he got but his scantling of Burgundy, and a little chit-chat along with it; so entering into a long conversation, as how he was chief gardener to the convent of <i>Andoüillets</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and out of friendship for the abbess and Mademoiselle <i>Margarita</i>, who was only in her noviciate, he had come along with them from the confines of <i>Savoy</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—and as how she had got a white swelling by her devotions⁠—and what a nation of herbs he had procured to mollify her humours, <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and that if the waters of <i>Bourbon</i> did not mend that leg⁠—she might as well be lame of both⁠—<abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—He so contrived his story, as absolutely to forget the heroine of it⁠—and with her the little novice, and what was a more ticklish point to be forgot than both⁠—the two mules; who being creatures that take advantage of the world, inasmuch as their parents took it of them⁠—and they not being in a condition to return the obligation <em>downwards</em> (as men and women and beasts are)⁠—they do it side-ways, and long-ways, and back-ways⁠—and up hill, and down hill, and which way they can.⁠———Philosophers, with all their ethicks, have never considered this rightly⁠—how should the poor muleteer, then in his cups, consider it at all? he did not in the least⁠—’tis time we do; let us leave him then in the vortex of his element, the happiest and most thoughtless of mortal men⁠——and for a moment let us look after the mules, the abbess, and <i>Margarita</i>.</p>
				<p>By virtue of the muleteer’s two last strokes the mules had gone quietly on, following their own consciences up the hill, till they had conquer’d about one half of it; when the elder of them, a shrewd crafty old devil, at the turn of an angle, giving a side glance, and no muleteer behind them⁠——</p>
				<p>By my fig! said she, swearing, I’ll go no further⁠——And if I do, replied the other, they shall make a drum of my hide.⁠——</p>
				<p>And so with one consent they stopp’d thus⁠——</p>
