			<h3 epub:type="title">A Dedication to a Great Man</h3>
			<p><b>My Lord</b>,</p>
			<p>Having, a priori, intended to dedicate <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Amours of My Uncle Toby</i> to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> ***⁠⸺⁠I see more reasons, a posteriori, for doing it to Lord *******.</p>
			<p>I should lament from my soul, if this exposed me to the jealousy of their Reverences; because a posteriori, in Court-latin, signifies the kissing hands for preferment⁠—or anything else⁠—in order to get it.</p>
			<p>My opinion of Lord ******* is neither better nor worse, than it was of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> ***. Honours, like impressions upon coin, may give an ideal and local value to a bit of base metal; but Gold and Silver will pass all the world over without any other recommendation than their own weight.</p>
			<p>The same goodwill that made me think of offering up half an hour’s amusement to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> *** when out of place⁠—operates more forcibly at present, as half an hour’s amusement will be more serviceable and refreshing after labour and sorrow, than after a philosophical repast.</p>
			<p>Nothing is so perfectly <i xml:lang="fr">amusement</i> as a total change of ideas; no ideas are so totally different as those of Ministers, and innocent Lovers: for which reason, when I come to talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and set such marks upon them as will prevent confusion and mistakes concerning them for the future⁠—I propose to dedicate that Volume to some gentle Shepherd,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>Whose thoughts proud Science never taught to stray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far as the Statesman’s walk or Patriot-way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet <em>simple Nature</em> to his hopes had given</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of a cloud-capp’d head a humbler heaven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some <em>untam’d</em> World in depths of wood embraced⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some happier Island in the watry-waste⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And where admitted to that equal sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His <em>faithful Dog</em> should bear him company.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>In a word, by thus introducing an entire new set of objects to his Imagination, I shall unavoidably give a <em>Diversion</em> to his passionate and lovesick Contemplations. In the meantime,</p>
