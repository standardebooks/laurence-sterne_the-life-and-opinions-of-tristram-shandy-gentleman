				<p>No matter⁠—as an appendage to seamstressy, the thread-paper might be of some consequence to my mother⁠—of none to my father, as a mark in <i>Slawkenbergius</i>. <i>Slawkenbergius</i> in every page of him was a rich treasure of inexhaustible knowledge to my father⁠—he could not open him amiss; and he would often say in closing the book, that if all the arts and sciences in the world, with the books which treated of them, were lost⁠—should the wisdom and policies of governments, he would say, through disuse, ever happen to be forgot, and all that statesmen had wrote or caused to be written, upon the strong or the weak sides of courts and kingdoms, should they be forgot also⁠—and <i>Slawkenbergius</i> only left⁠⸺⁠there would be enough in him in all conscience, he would say, to set the world a-going again. A treasure therefore was he indeed! an institute of all that was necessary to be known of noses, and everything else⁠—at matin, noon, and vespers was <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i> his recreation and delight: ’twas forever in his hands⁠⸺⁠you would have sworn, Sir, it had been a canon’s prayerbook⁠—so worn, so glazed, so contrited and attrited was it with fingers and with thumbs in all its parts, from one end even unto the other.</p>
				<p>I am not such a bigot to <i>Slawkenbergius</i> as my father;⁠⸺⁠there is a fund in him, no doubt: but in my opinion, the best, I don’t say the most profitable, but the most amusing part of <i>Hafen Slawkenbergius</i>, is his tales⁠⸻and, considering he was a <i>German</i>, many of them told not without fancy:⁠⸻these take up his second book, containing nearly one half of his folio, and are comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten tales⁠⸻Philosophy is not built upon tales; and therefore ’twas certainly wrong in <i>Slawkenbergius</i> to send them into the world by that name!⁠⸺⁠there are a few of them in his eighth, ninth, and tenth decads, which I own seem rather playful and sportive, than speculative⁠—but in general they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many independent facts, all of them turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges of his subject, and collected by him with great fidelity, and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the doctrines of noses.</p>
				<p>As we have leisure enough upon our hands⁠⸺⁠if you give me leave, madam, I’ll tell you the ninth tale of his tenth decad.</p>
