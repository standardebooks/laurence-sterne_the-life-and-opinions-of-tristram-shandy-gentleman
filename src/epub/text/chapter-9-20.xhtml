				<p>——You shall see the very place, Madam; said my uncle <i>Toby</i>.</p>
				<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> blush’d⁠——look’d towards the door⁠——turn’d pale⁠——blush’d slightly again⁠——recover’d her natural colour⁠——blush’d worse than ever; which, for the sake of the unlearned reader, I translate thus⁠——</p>
				<div class="ital">
					<p>“L⁠—d! I cannot look at it⁠——</p>
					<p>What would the world say if I look’d at it?</p>
					<p>I should drop down, if I look’d at it⁠—</p>
					<p>I wish I could look at it⁠——</p>
					<p>There can be no sin in looking at it.</p>
					<p>——I will look at it.”</p>
				</div>
				<p>Whilst all this was running through <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman’s</i> imagination, my uncle <i>Toby</i> had risen from the sopha, and got to the other side of the parlour door, to give <i>Trim</i> an order about it in the passage⁠——</p>
				<p><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span>⁠——I believe it is in the garret, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠——I saw it there, an’ please your honour, this morning, answered <i>Trim</i>⁠——Then prithee, step directly for it, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and bring it into the parlour.</p>
				<p>The corporal did not approve of the orders, but most chearfully obeyed them. The first was not an act of his will⁠—the second was; so he put on his <i>Montero</i>-cap, and went as fast as his lame knee would let him. My uncle <i>Toby</i> returned into the parlour, and sat himself down again upon the sopha.</p>
				<p>——You shall lay your finger upon the place⁠—said my uncle <i>Toby</i>.⁠——I will not touch it, however, quoth <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> to herself.</p>
				<p>This requires a second translation:⁠—it shews what little knowledge is got by mere words⁠—we must go up to the first springs.</p>
				<p>Now in order to clear up the mist which hangs upon these three pages, I must endeavour to be as clear as possible myself.</p>
				<p>Rub your hands thrice across your foreheads⁠—blow your noses⁠—cleanse your emunctories⁠—sneeze, my good people!⁠——God bless you⁠——</p>
				<p>Now give me all the help you can.</p>
