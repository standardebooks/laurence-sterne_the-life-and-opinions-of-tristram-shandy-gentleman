				<h2 epub:type="title z3998:roman">II</h2>
				<p>It is with <span class="smallroman">LOVE</span> as with <span class="smallroman">CUCKOLDOM</span>——</p>
				<p>But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader, which, if not imparted now, can never be imparted to him as long as I live (whereas the <span class="smallroman">COMPARISON</span> may be imparted to him any hour in the day)——I’ll just mention it, and begin in good earnest.</p>
				<p>The thing is this.</p>
				<p>That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in practice throughout the known world, I am confident my own way of doing it is the best——I’m sure it is the most religious——for I begin with writing the first sentence——and trusting to Almighty God for the second.</p>
				<p>’Twould cure an author for ever of the fuss and folly of opening his street-door, and calling in his neighbours and friends, and kinsfolk, with the devil and all his imps, with their hammers and engines, &amp;c., only to observe how one sentence of mine follows another, and how the plan follows the whole.</p>
				<p>I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair, with what confidence, as I grasp the elbow of it, I look up——catching the idea, even sometimes before it half way reaches <span class="locked">me——</span></p>
				<p>I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which heaven intended for another man.</p>
				<p><i>Pope</i> and his Portrait<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a> are fools to me——no martyr is ever so full of faith or fire——I wish I could say of good works too——but I have no</p>
				<p class="super">Zeal or Anger——or<br/> Anger or Zeal——</p>
				<p>And till gods and men agree together to call it by the same name——the errantest <span class="smallcaps">Tartuffe</span>, in science—in politics—or in religion, shall never kindle a spark within me, or have a worse word, or a more unkind greeting, than what he will read in the next chapter.</p>
