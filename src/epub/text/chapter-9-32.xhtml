				<p>There will be just time, whilst my uncle <i>Toby</i> and <i>Trim</i> are walking to my father’s, to inform you that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Wadman</i> had, some moons before this, made a confident of my mother; and that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <i>Bridget</i>, who had the burden of her own, as well as her mistress’s secret to carry, had got happily delivered of both to <i>Susannah</i> behind the garden-wall.</p>
				<p>As for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the least bustle about⁠⸺⁠but <i>Susannah</i> was sufficient by herself for all the ends and purposes you could possibly have, in exporting a family secret; for she instantly imparted it by signs to <i>Jonathan</i>⁠⸺⁠and <i>Jonathan</i> by tokens to the cook as she was basting a loin of mutton; the cook sold it with some kitchen-fat to the postillion for a groat, who truck’d it with the dairy maid for something of about the same value⁠⸺⁠and though whisper’d in the hayloft, <b>Fame</b> caught the notes with her brazen trumpet, and sounded them upon the housetop⁠—In a word, not an old woman in the village or five miles round, who did not understand the difficulties of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> siege, and what were the secret articles which had delayed the surrender.⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>My father, whose way was to force every event in nature into an hypothesis, by which means never man crucified <b>Truth</b> at the rate he did⁠⸺⁠had but just heard of the report as my uncle <i>Toby</i> set out; and catching fire suddenly at the trespass done his brother by it, was demonstrating to <i>Yorick</i>, notwithstanding my mother was sitting by⁠⸺⁠not only, “That the devil was in women, and that the whole of the affair was lust;” but that every evil and disorder in the world, of what kind or nature soever, from the first fall of <i>Adam</i>, down to my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> (inclusive), was owing one way or other to the same unruly appetite.</p>
				<p><i>Yorick</i> was just bringing my father’s hypothesis to some temper, when my uncle <i>Toby</i> entering the room with marks of infinite benevolence and forgiveness in his looks, my father’s eloquence rekindled against the passion⁠⸺⁠and as he was not very nice in the choice of his words when he was wroth⁠⸺⁠as soon as my uncle <i>Toby</i> was seated by the fire, and had filled his pipe, my father broke out in this manner.</p>
