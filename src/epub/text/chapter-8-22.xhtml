				<p>I had escaped, continued the corporal, all that time from falling in love, and had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it not been predestined otherwise⁠——there is no resisting our fate.</p>
				<p>It was on a <i>Sunday</i>, in the afternoon, as I told your honour.</p>
				<p>The old man and his wife had walked out⁠——</p>
				<p>Everything was still and hush as midnight about the house⁠——</p>
				<p>There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the yard⁠——</p>
				<p>——When the fair <i>Beguine</i> came in to see me.</p>
				<p>My wound was then in a fair way of doing well⁠——the inflammation had been gone off for some time, but it was succeeded with an itching both above and below my knee, so insufferable, that I had not shut my eyes the whole night for it.</p>
				<p>Let me see it, said she, kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below it⁠——it only wants rubbing a little, said the <i>Beguine</i>; so covering it with the bed-clothes, she began with the forefinger of her right hand to rub under my knee, guiding her forefinger backwards and forwards by the edge of the <em>flannel</em> which kept on the dressing.</p>
				<p>In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second finger⁠—and presently it was laid flat with the other, and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while; it then came into my head, that I should fall in love⁠—I blush’d when I saw how white a hand she had⁠—I shall never, an’ please your honour, behold another hand so white whilst I live⁠——</p>
				<p>——Not in that place; said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠——</p>
				<p>Though it was the most serious despair in nature to the corporal⁠—he could not forbear smiling.</p>
				<p>The young <i>Beguine</i>, continued the corporal, perceiving it was of great service to me⁠—from rubbing for some time, with two fingers⁠—proceeded to rub at length, with three⁠—till by little and little she brought down the fourth, and then rubb’d with her whole hand: I will never say another word, an’ please your honour, upon hands again⁠—but it was softer than sattin⁠—</p>
				<p>——Prithee, <i>Trim</i>, commend it as much as thou wilt, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>; I shall hear thy story with the more delight⁠——The corporal thank’d his master most unfeignedly; but having nothing to say upon the <i>Beguine’s</i> hand but the same over again⁠——he proceeded to the effects of it.</p>
				<p>The fair <i>Beguine</i>, said the corporal, continued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee⁠—till I fear’d her zeal would weary her⁠——“I would do a thousand times more,” said she, “for the love of Christ”⁠——In saying which, she pass’d her hand across the flannel, to the part above my knee, which I had equally complain’d of, and rubb’d it also.</p>
				<p>I perceived, then, I was beginning to be in love⁠——</p>
				<p>As she continued rub-rub-rubbing⁠—I felt it spread from under her hand, an’ please your honour, to every part of my frame.⁠——</p>
				<p>The more she rubb’d, and the longer strokes she took⁠——the more the fire kindled in my veins⁠——till at length, by two or three strokes longer than the rest⁠——my passion rose to the highest pitch⁠——I seiz’d her hand⁠——</p>
				<p>——And then thou clapped’st it to thy lips, <i>Trim</i>, said my uncle <i>Toby</i>⁠——and madest a speech.</p>
				<p>Whether the corporal’s amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle <i>Toby</i> described it, is not material; it is enough that it contained in it the essence of all the love romances which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world.</p>
