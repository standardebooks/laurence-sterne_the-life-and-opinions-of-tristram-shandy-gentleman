				<p>As I perceived the commissary of the post-office would have his six livres four sous, I had nothing else for it, but to say some smart thing upon the occasion, worth the money:</p>
				<p>And so I set off thus:⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠And pray, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Commissary, by what law of courtesy is a defenceless stranger to be used just the reverse from what you use a <i>Frenchman</i> in this matter?</p>
				<p>By no means; said he.</p>
				<p>Excuse me; said I⁠—for you have begun, Sir, with first tearing off my breeches⁠—and now you want my pocket⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>Whereas⁠—had you first taken my pocket, as you do with your own people⁠—and then left me bare a⁠⸺’d after⁠—I had been a beast to have complain’d⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>As it is⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺’Tis contrary to the <em>law of nature</em>.</p>
				<p>⸺’Tis contrary to <em>reason</em>.</p>
				<p>⸺’Tis contrary to the <strong>gospel</strong>.</p>
				<p>But not to this⁠⸺⁠said he⁠—putting a printed paper into my hand,</p>
				<blockquote xml:lang="fr">
					<p><b>Par le Roy</b>.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>⸺⸺’Tis a pithy prolegomenon, quoth I⁠—and so read on⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻⁠⸻⸻</p>
				<p>⸺⁠By all which it appears, quoth I, having read it over, a little too rapidly, that if a man sets out in a post-chaise from <i>Paris</i>⁠—he must go on travelling in one, all the days of his life⁠—or pay for it.⁠—Excuse me, said the commissary, the spirit of the ordinance is this⁠—That if you set out with an intention of running post from <i>Paris</i> to <i>Avignon</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, you shall not change that intention or mode of travelling, without first satisfying the fermiers for two posts further than the place you repent at⁠—and ’tis founded, continued he, upon this, that the <strong>revenues</strong> are not to fall short through your <em>fickleness</em>⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p>⸺⁠O by heavens! cried I⁠—if fickleness is taxable in <i>France</i>⁠—we have nothing to do but to make the best peace with you we can⁠⸺⁠</p>
				<p><b>And so the peace was made</b>;</p>
				<p>⸺⁠And if it is a bad one⁠—as <i>Tristram Shandy</i> laid the cornerstone of it⁠—nobody but <i>Tristram Shandy</i> ought to be hanged.</p>
