				<p>Amongst the many ill consequences of the treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>, it was within a point of giving my uncle <i>Toby</i> a surfeit of sieges; and though he recovered his appetite afterwards, yet <i>Calais</i> itself left not a deeper scar in <i>Mary’s</i> heart, than <i>Utrecht</i> upon my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>. To the end of his life he never could hear <i>Utrecht</i> mentioned upon any account whatever,⁠—or so much as read an article of news extracted out of the <i>Utrecht Gazette</i>, without fetching a sigh, as if his heart would break in twain.</p>
				<p>My father, who was a great <strong>motive-monger</strong>, and consequently a very dangerous person for a man to sit by, either laughing or crying,⁠—for he generally knew your motive for doing both, much better than you knew it yourself⁠—would always console my uncle <i>Toby</i> upon these occasions, in a way, which showed plainly, he imagined my uncle <i>Toby</i> grieved for nothing in the whole affair, so much as the loss of his <em>hobbyhorse</em>.⁠——Never mind, brother <i>Toby</i>, he would say,⁠—by God’s blessing we shall have another war break out again some of these days; and when it does,⁠—the belligerent powers, if they would hang themselves, cannot keep us out of play.⁠——I defy ’em, my dear <i>Toby</i>, he would add, to take countries without taking towns,⁠——or towns without sieges.</p>
				<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> never took this backstroke of my father’s at his hobbyhorse kindly.⁠——He thought the stroke ungenerous; and the more so, because in striking the horse he hit the rider too, and in the most dishonourable part a blow could fall; so that upon these occasions, he always laid down his pipe upon the table with more fire to defend himself than common.</p>
				<p>I told the reader, this time two years, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> was not eloquent; and in the very same page gave an instance to the contrary:⁠——I repeat the observation, and a fact which contradicts it again.⁠—He was not eloquent,⁠—it was not easy to my uncle <i>Toby</i> to make long harangues,⁠—and he hated florid ones; but there were occasions where the stream overflowed the man, and ran so counter to its usual course, that in some parts my uncle <i>Toby</i>, for a time, was at least equal to <i>Tertullus</i>⁠——but in others, in my own opinion, infinitely above him.</p>
				<p>My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical orations of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>, which he had delivered one evening before him and <i>Yorick</i>, that he wrote it down before he went to bed.</p>
				<p>I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my father’s papers, with here and there an insertion of his own, betwixt two crooks, thus [ ], and is endorsed,</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<b>My Brother Toby’s Justification of His Own Principles and Conduct in Wishing to Continue the War</b>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I may safely say, I have read over this apologetical oration of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> a hundred times, and think it so fine a model of defence,⁠—and shows so sweet a temperament of gallantry and good principles in him, that I give it the world, word for word (interlineations and all), as I find it.</p>
